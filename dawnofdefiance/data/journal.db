Though he fights if cornered, the researcher prefers to think that he is safe in the facility, and as such he never considers the possibility that anyone would intrude on his work.</p>\n<p>Dressed in the sterile white robes of doctors throughout the galaxy, the man seems to be little more than a scientist. The insignia of the Empire sits on a patch on each shoulder, but otherwise he looks like a normal medical researcher.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[U7s1bKirrDZcqSpY]{Medical Researcher}</strong></p>\n<h4>Imperial Medical Researcher Tactics</h4>\n<p>Once combat breaks out, the <strong>medical researcher </strong>tries to let the genetically modified <strong>Felucians </strong>do his dirty work for him. Additionally, he commands the <strong>2-1B medical droid</strong> to engage in combat as well, hoping to throw anything he can at the heroes. If all else fails, he uses his blaster pistol.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[HRdNcqcw4qyhCJRB]{Medical Droid}</strong></p>\n<h2>Genetically Modified Felucian</h2>\n<p><strong>Captain Vischera’s</strong> early experiments led to the creation of violent <strong>Felucians </strong>with weapons built into their bodies. By removing their right forearms and causing the bones of their elbows and upper arms to mutate, <strong>Vischera </strong>created nasty blades out of their arm bones, meaning that the modified <strong>Felucians </strong>cannot be disarmed. The genetic mutations also made these <strong>Felucians </strong>stronger and more aggressive. Moreover, the modified <strong>Felucians </strong>have several chitinous scales (taken from the body of a local breed of <strong>rancor</strong>) grafted onto their flesh, making them hybrid monstrosities that are barely recognizable as their former selves.</p>\n<p>This <strong>Felucian </strong>has clearly undergone some kind of mutation; its muscles bulge and its body seems to bend in unnatural places. The creature’s right forearm has been removed entirely, and instead a long bone blade extends from the elbow, growing out of the flesh with a ragged, serrated edge. Thick, tough-looking scales grow out of the <strong>Felucian’s </strong>body.</p>\n<p>2 <strong>@Actor[NveyO4RE7Yf3Pcp6]{Genetically Modified Felucians}</strong></p>\n<h4>Genetically Modified Felucian Tactics</h4>\n<p>The genetically modified <strong>Felucians </strong>are little more than brutes. Their minds have been eroded by constant experimentation, and they obey the Imperial medical researcher’s commands even if it results in their deaths. The <strong>Felucians </strong>use their fused blades to the exclusion of all other tactics, charging in to attack the heroes with reckless abandon.</p>\n<h4>Features of the Area</h4>\n<p>This room is filled with medical equipment of all kinds. The beds (where the <strong>Felucians </strong>are secured until combat begins) provide low cover to anyone standing adjacent to them. Additionally, if any of the bacta tanks takes more than <strong>5 points </strong>of <strong>damage</strong>, it shatters and spills bacta onto the floor. When this happens, unless a character moves at half speed, the character must succeed on a <strong>DC 10 Acrobatics check </strong>or fall prone.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/tiles/Imperial%20Research%20Lab.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"799\" /></p>","folder":"NIv6HkZv2u8T9iaX","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Since the <strong>warden droids</strong> have no <strong>ranged attacks</strong>, they constantly try to maneuver themselves between the heroes and the detention block guards, providing the guards with cover while the guards fire shots at the heroes.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the encounter has concluded, the heroes can free <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> from the holding area with little difficulty. The other three <strong>prisoners </strong>are also eager to leave. They would prefer to make a break for it through the front door and flee into the <strong>Felucian jungle</strong>—a dangerous prospect at best.

When the heroes burst onto the scene, the sergeant immediately moves to take cover behind the nearest crates and calls for backup. When necessary he activates his <strong>Leadership</strong> ability. The officer piloting the repulsor sled releases the tow cable pulling the hovering block of carbonite, and the other officers move to take down the heroes as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h4>Features of the Area</h4>\n<p>This encounter features a large, open hangar bay with a number of places to hide and seek cover. Additionally, part of the encounter involves recovering an <strong>Alderaanian agent frozen in carbonite</strong>. The carbonite block has its own repulsors and hovers at roughly waist height on a Human. The block can be moved as a free action when someone else moves with it, though the person moving the block must remain adjacent to it throughout its movement.

This adventure takes the heroes straight into the heart of the Empire and the Sarlacc Project. They should advance to 13th level by the conclusion of the adventure. During the course of this adventure, the heroes pursue the Sarlacc Project to the Imperial capital world of Coruscant, now known as Imperial Center. While searching for the source of the project, the heroes learn the realities of life at the center of the Empire, while pursuing leads under the glare of Imperial security, the likes of which they have not encountered before. Ultimately, the heroes manage to locate the source of the Sarlacc Project, though it may not be exactly what they expect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IS DAWN OF DEFIANCE?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dawn of Defiance is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the adventures in the Dawn of Defiance campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic SW5e experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The Dawn of Defiance campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Dawn of Defiance adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Warning! If you will be playing in a Dawn of Defiance campaign or in a campaign utilizing its adventures, read no further.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This adventure assumes that you have run your heroes through the previous Dawn of Defiance adventures, particularly the fifth adventure, The First To Strike. The heroes should already be acquainted with Admiral Varth and the Alderaanian starship Resurgence. The events on the planet Nizon should be fresh in their minds, since they have had little downtime since their return to the Resurgence. The heroes also should know that they returned with significant intelligence, and they should be awaiting its analysis with great interest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you aren’t running Dawn of Defiance but would like to use this adventure in your home campaign, you may adapt it to your own needs. First, replace the Sarlacc Project with a goal integrated into your campaign. This might be a person to be saved or an object or information to be retrieved. In any case, it is something that must be found on Coruscant. It should also be something worthy of the Inquisitors’ interest, since the final encounters force to heroes to take the Inquisitors head-on. If you ran the previous adventure, The First to Strike, perhaps the goal could be to find a captured character or even a player, such as a Jedi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is highly recommended that you read the entire adventure thoroughly before running it. Much of the adventure focuses on investigating the location of the Sarlacc Project and allows the heroes to move around Coruscant as needed to follow leads. Because there is no set progression between the sources they may choose to investigate, the heroes will likely jump around from encounter to encounter in Part 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUMMARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While on the planet Nizon, the heroes obtained intelligence related to the origins of the Sarlacc Project. Upon returning to the Resurgence, the data is analyzed, prompting Admiral Varth to recall them to the mission briefing room and fill them in on the details. It seems that the engineers of the Sarlacc Project are in an Imperial facility on Coruscant, and the heroes must seek them out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Admiral Varth provides the necessary codes and permissions for the heroes to enter the Coruscant system. They must slip through Imperial security undetected, secure a landing pad, and establish a base of operations. Using a multitude of skills, contacts, information gathering and scrounging, the heroes must pinpoint the location of the project’s architects and engineers. Above all, they must not attract attention from the ISB or any other Imperial organization. Their investigations may include the underworld, Imperial computer networks, Alderaanian contacts, and a little help from the Force.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eventually, the heroes discover that the designers are located in an unfinished skyscraper. They must ascertain a method of entry and ascend to the highest levels of the structure. Upon locating the designers, the heroes soon realize the warped and horrific design process in place. However, before they can do much about it, the project’s true managers appear—the dreaded Imperial Inquisitors. The Inquisitors cannot afford for the project to be revealed and fight to the death if needed. When defeat seems imminent, they trigger a self-destruct, forcing the heroes to find their way out of the collapsing building. Even after they have escaped, the heroes must elude Imperial security and emergency rescue teams until they can flee the scene.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ultimately, the heroes learn the details of the Sarlacc Project. The Empire is constructing a massive new starship many times larger than a Star Destroyer, which is an early prototype (though not the final version) of the Super Star Destroyer. The new vessel will serve as the flagship of the Imperial fleet, and the Sarlacc Project nears completion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OPENING CRAWL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS : DAWN OF DEFIANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Episode VI: The Core of Corruption</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Nazren uprising is over.

There they must continue their desperate search for the Sarlacc Project, under the oppressive gaze of the Empire itself . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 1: INTO THE CORE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In The Core of Corruption, the heroes learn the significance of the data that they received on Nizon, prompting them to take the search for the Sarlacc Project to Coruscant. They have had very little downtime since their return to the Resurgence and the conclusion of their previous adventure. It takes only a day or two for Admiral Varth and the Resurgence crew to analyze the data. Upon learning its results, the Admiral wastes no time in reassembling the heroes in the briefing room to give them their next assignment. If the heroes did not participate in the events on Nizon, they need only be told that the information was obtained by another group of agents during the recent Nazren uprising on Nizon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have had little time to heal or recover. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, speed is essential. Any heroes who may require extended healing, repair, or recovery will find that they must patch up themselves and their equipment as best as they can before they go. They have time to meet with anyone who is already aboard the Resurgence, but they are not allowed to communicate with anyone outside of the ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE BRIEFING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Admiral Varth calls the heroes to the briefing room within 24 to 48 hours after they return to the ship. The Admiral is impatiently awaiting their arrival, along with the now-familiar yellow and silver astromech assisting droid. Resurgence Captain Verana is also in attendance. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you enter the stark white briefing room, Admiral Varth waits impatiently for you to take your seats. The Admiral looks extremely tired and sleep deprived. It takes you a moment to realize that Captain Verana sits nearby, near the familiar assisting astromech droid. Admiral Varth begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Congratulations. The data you obtained on Nizon is very revealing, so much so that I fear that once the Empire realizes it has been compromised, they will take steps to invalidate it. I’m afraid that time is not on our side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Thanks to you, we now know the origin of the Sarlacc Project, if not its final purpose.” The Admiral signals the droid, and the holoprojector activates, showing a very familiar city-planet. “I suppose we should not be surprised that the project’s origin and design team resides on Imper—I mean, Coruscant. I do not believe that the entire project is housed there, given the casualty figures I have seen in my former Imperial life. However, it is apparent from the new data that the project is controlled from somewhere in this area.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Admiral waves at the droid, and the view zooms to the planet’s surface, highlighting a large district that includes some of the Empire’s most important governmental structures, such as the Imperial Senate. “Unfortunately, we do not have an exact fix on the building or agency directly responsible for the project. The leads we have are impossible to pursue remotely. Therefore, we must send you in as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Captain Verana speaks in a serious tone. “Before we delve into the details, you should know that our benefactor has fully authorized this mission, and he wanted me to personally assure you of its importance.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The holoprojector zooms out to show thousands of starships, space stations, and satellites orbiting or approaching Coruscant. “Coruscant is, of course, the center of the Empire. If you have not been to the system since the days of the Republic, the amount of traffic and the level of security may astound you. Peace and order, even under an oppressive government, have brought new opportunities to corporations and individuals throughout the galaxy. Between the prosperity of the Core Worlds and the rebuilding of the planets damaged by the Clone Wars, traffic to Coruscant has increased many times what it was only a few years ago. Security has also increased, so it will be vital that you have the proper documentation and permits to approach the system and land at a suitable port. I will provide this for you.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With that, the Admiral finally takes a seat, leaving the holoprojector on as a nearly silent reminder of your final destination. “Now, I’m sure you have additional questions.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The following questions should be answered by the Admiral; however, Captain Verana may interject when needed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why should we do this for you? “We would hope that by now you are fully dedicated to discovering and stopping this project. However, we have been authorized to provide you with 5,000 credits each and equipment and weaponry available from the Resurgence’s stores to replace those that you lost on Nizon. We may also repair your ship, if required.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When do we leave? “As soon as you’re ready—hopefully, within the next 24 hours.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How do we get to Coruscant? “You should take your own ship. If your ship is unavailable for some reason, we can provide you with an unarmed small light freighter. In either case, we will provide the required licenses. Any borrowed ships must be returned to us.” The provided freighter is a battered YT-1300 called the Onderon Sky, use the statistics of the YT-1300 freighter from Echoes of the Jedi minus the weapons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What should we expect when approaching Coruscant? “You should expect tight security when approaching the planet. You must enter the system near a designated hyperspace buoy and contact Imperial Center control immediately. Remember to call it Imperial Center. They will direct you to an approved spacelane to your requested starport. Do not deviate from this flight path. Assume that you are always under surveillance, even though it is unlikely to be focused on you. With the credentials we’re providing, you should not expect any trouble. However, it is always possible that Imperial customs will see fit to inspect the vessel, either by sensors or singling you out for boarding. I highly recommend that you do nothing to draw attention to yourselves. There are literally thousands of Imperial military vessels in the system, so any combat is likely to end swiftly and extremely badly for you.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How good are our credentials, licenses, and papers? “Between my own expertise and resources of Captain Verana, we have assembled all the proper licenses and permits, altered for your specific vessel. Our highly placed contacts will enter this data into the BoSS systems before you depart. If you’re using your own vessel, we must make a couple of alterations to your sublight drive to make sure the transponders match. The alteration should be detectable only if someone actually physically examines your transponder. All licenses will be in your proper names, or in alternative identities if you already have ones that can withstand direct Imperial scrutiny.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What were you (Admiral Varth) going to say instead of ‘Coruscant’? (in the boxed text) “Sorry, but some habits die hard. I was about to refer to Coruscant as Imperial Center, which of course is its formal Imperial name.” (This is a minor hint as to Varth’s ultimate loyalty.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How will we know the benefactor’s agents if they contact us? Admiral Varth says, “I’m not exactly sure. I’m told that it may be somebody you have worked with before.” Sometime after the briefing when the Admiral is not around, Captain Verana tells the heroes that Tero Reskan will be their contact. He also gives them a comlink code and the sign/countersign “We broke our droid./ I hope you meant to.” The Captain makes it clear that this information is extremely sensitive, and the heroes are not to reveal the name or passwords to anyone, including the Admiral. There is always the possibility of Imperial spies aboard the Resurgence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Where will we stay on Coruscant? “We arranged docking at the Cloudscape Platforms, a private starport used by Core World travelers and small-scale merchants. I highly recommend finding some accommodations elsewhere. That way, if you draw the attention of the ISB, they may not immediately locate your ship.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How do we find the source of the Sarlacc Project? “An excellent question. The best we can provide is several starting points. For instance, we’ve discovered that the Sarlacc Project data is broadcast in a specific frequency range. You may be able to locate the source, but it will not be easy. It is likely a tight-beam transmission to some sort of messenger droid or secret receiving station. We have also identified individuals whose names have shown up on communiqués and delivery reports. One is ISB Agent Lesan Dos, whose exact connection to the project is unknown. It was also discovered that routing codes pertaining to a protocol droid called CZ-3T6 have been discovered on many outgoing messages. The final possibility is a Sullustan called Resh, who was a former associate of Darga the Hutt and tied into the Hutt’s material delivery services. If you can locate one or more of these individuals, they may be able to lead you in the right direction.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What do we do when we find the source of the Sarlacc Project? “You must find and infiltrate the source, discover exactly what the project is, and learn where it is located. Relay any vital data through our benefactor’s contacts on Coruscant, then send what you can back to the Resurgence</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL CENTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite the Admiral’s ominous warnings, the heroes’ jump to Coruscant starts without any issues. The navigation data is excellent (less than one week old). Once the heroes arrive in-system, an unusual combination of circumstances might make them uncomfortable and a bit nervous. You should play this up at any opportunity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARRIVAL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at hyperspace buoy IC-772, a quick scan reveals a scene much like what was on the holoprojector. Hundreds of ships are in the area, following specific spacelanes from the buoy to their ultimate destinations. The standard Message to Spacers (METSOP) directs incoming ships to immediately contact Imperial Center control. If they linger too long, they receive a stern hail from one of the space traffic control droids requesting identification and destination, after which the heroes are ordered to Imperial Center Approach Vector ICAV-7A, lest they become an obstacle for incoming ships. In fact, the heroes should realize that a new ship drops from hyperspace near the buoy once every few minutes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the spacelane, their ship’s collision warning abruptly sounds. An enormous Action VI bulk transport drops out of hyperspace out of position and crosses their path at an odd angle. A DC 25 Intelligence (Piloting) check is required to avoid a collision off the ship’s stern. If the ships collide, the heroes’ ship takes 36 (5d8) points of kinetic damage (if the player's ship has shields, the damage is reduced by half). A collision also attracts the attention of a nearby Imperial System Patrol Craft, which stops both ships to scan for damage and take a report from each.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whether or not they collide, the sudden strain on the heroes’ sublight drive is enough to blow out multiple couplings and motivators. A DC 25 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check reveals that the control systems are damaged, but they can be repaired in-flight. A DC 30 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check temporarily bypasses some of the damage. Periodic DC 25 Intelligence (Piloting) checks are required to keep the ship on course while repairs are made. Repairs require a DC 22 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) and take about an hour and a half. Stopping the ship won’t save a significant amount of time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>APPROACH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes follow the prescribed path transmitted to their navigation system. It takes two hours to get to Imperial Center orbit. Along the way, pairs of TIE fighters and Imperial customs ships occasionally sweep the spacelane, scanning ships of interest. If the heroes’ ship deviates during the approach or if you want to add some tension, a customs ship investigates. It hails the heroes, scans their ship, and electronically verifies their transponder and licenses. Unless the heroes do something foolish, they should pass without incident. If the heroes manage to start a fight, eight TIE fighter reinforcements arrive in 2 rounds and an Imperial Star Destroyer begins to head their way, though it is too far away to do anything for several minutes other than demand their surrender. About halfway into their journey, the Star Destroyer Assiduous drops from hyperspace nearby and proceeds at maximum sublight speed toward Coruscant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes (and all other ships) are immediately ordered to halt while the ship passes. When the ship passes briefly within 60 miles, force sensitive characters must make a DC 20 Wisdom (Deception) or Charisma (Deception) check. Do not tell them if they succeed or fail, but they should be left questioning who might have been aboard the Star Destroyer. The ship leaves their range before any heroes can attempt to detect what happened through the force. Increase their unease by having a customs ship or TIE fighter patrol do a fly-by afterward. Ideally, this encounter will encourage the heroes to keep a very low profile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes’ ship reaches orbit, Imperial Central control orders them into Landing Vector ICLV-0192R. They follow it down to one of the many skylanes jammed with traffic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CLOUDSCAPE PLATFORMS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Using the skylanes, the heroes must follow their directions to reach the Cloudscape Platforms. No fancy flying is allowed, and if anyone does anything outrageous or otherwise leaves the skylane, an airspeeder patrol quickly pursues them and orders them to land at a nearby garrison, where the ship is thoroughly searched, their IDs are scrutinized, and the captain is fined 15,000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is late evening as they approach the platform. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you pass through the infinite cityscape of Imperial Center, the sun glows red as it drops behind the horizon. You see its burning red reflection off of thousands of speeders and ships crisscrossing the sky in unending lines. Impossibly tall metal and glass skyscrapers glow with a firelike intensity in the setting sun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Following the skylane, you approach a tall spire flanked with dozens of vaguely cloud-shaped exterior landing platforms at a multitude of levels. Each is a massive cantilevered structure, which also forms a single bridge to the spire itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In stark contrast to the central control droids, a female Human voice politely greets the heroes as they approach and invites them to land at platform CP32L. Even though this is a private facility, Imperial customs agents still inspect almost every vessel that passes through, and the Cloudscape admin tells them as much, if asked. When the ship lands on an outdoor circular platform about twice its size, Imperial Customs Agent Talee is impatiently waiting nearby, flanked by four stormtroopers. Although this is standard procedure on Coruscant, the heroes may not know it, and it should put them on edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Talee’s demeanor is cold and professional. He’s dedicated but otherwise very average. He demands that everyone disembark while the stormtroopers sweep the vessel. He inspects the heroes’ personal IDs and licenses (for weapons and such) as well as those belonging to the ship. He personally inspects any cargo and compares it to the manifest. Make Wisdom (Perception) rolls versus the heroes Dexterity (Stealth) rolls for any items they may have attempted to hide on their person or in the ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Talee asks questions regarding any irregularities, fishing for more information. This is a good opportunity for charismatic characters to attempt to smooth over rough spots or divert attention from troublesome issues. Talee issues fines for infractions regarding the ship or personal licenses. These fines range from 500 to 1,000 credits each and must be paid via credit account to Imperial Customs within four hours, not directly to him. He is by the book and accepts no bribes. If any hero shows up in the computer system as wanted, Talee orders that hero to be arrested by the stormtroopers. If the heroes resist or make any trouble, backup lands on the platform after 20 rounds (see the Rapid Response Force encounter, page 16), assuming that Talee is able to call for help. Essentially, the heroes should be nervous about the inspection and perusal of their paperwork, but unless something is really wrong, they will probably get off with a few fines and a lot of wasted time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players engage Talee in combat, use the Junior Officer statblock for him and for the four stormtroopers that accompany him, use two trooper statblocks and two heavy trooper statblocks from Scum and Villainy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-hoc XP Award: Characters who complete the landing and inspection without being arrested or incurring fines totaling more than 15,000 credits receive experience points as though they had defeated a CR 11 encounter. Reduce this reward if they took unnecessary risks or sustained large fines. Do not grant this award if they enter combat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MAKING TROUBLE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes making trouble on Coruscant should expect a swift Imperial response. Most citizens quickly report any irregularities, especially on the upper levels of the city. The public ignition of a lightsaber or the obvious use of a Force power is a virtual death sentence and triggers a major manhunt. At your discretion, dispatched Imperials may be regular stormtroopers, Coruscant Guards, or a Coruscant Rapid Response Force</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any characters who are arrested or captured by the Imperials are held in detention facilities for the remainder of the adventure, essentially treated as dead characters per the campaign standards. Escape or rescue is not possible. Depending on the circumstances, Senator Organa may quietly arrange for their release at the end of the adventure, if doing so will not expose his true loyalties. Captured Jedi are especially problematic, since they are sent directly to the Inquisitorius and are beyond the reach of even an Imperial Senator. However, they are held in the Imeici Spire and may be rescued in Part 3 of this adventure. If you wish, the player of a captured Jedi may create a new character, playing as an aide to Tero Reskan until the end of the adventure. This is also a good way to introduce new players or characters to the game, if needed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: IN THE HEART OF THE EMPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Having taken care of their bureaucratic obligations, the heroes are free to explore the city. This section of the adventure is nonlinear, allowing the heroes to follow leads using their best skills and ideas. They likely will attempt several methods at once, with different characters gravitating to their strengths. If possible, you should encourage them to focus on one lead at a time for simplicity, rather than letting them split up the party. All characters should contribute to the investigation somehow, perhaps by using a skill, meeting with a contact that nobody else has access to, or simply providing muscle when investigating the less savory levels of Coruscant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes must learn the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A new tower called the Imeici Spire houses the Sarlacc Project (learned from Resh, from CZ-3T6, or by detecting Sarlacc Project transmissions from the tower)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An ISB code cylinder is required to access the tower (learned from Resh)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How to enter the tower and acquire the equipment needed to do so (learned from Resh and investigating the building itself)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition, the heroes must obtain the code cylinder from Agent Dos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GETTING STARTED</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes must first see to their ship. A Cloudscape administrator meets them immediately after the customs inspector is done. Docking fees are 1,000 credits per day plus any additional services they desire, such as refueling. The ship remains on the platform unless the heroes wish to upgrade to an internal hangar for quadruple the cost. Security is quite good, especially with stormtroopers on the premises. The heroes may stay aboard their ship, but they should find that a hotel closer to transportation hubs is more convenient and less public. If needed, they can locate a ship’s parking platform in the mid levels at half the cost by making a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACCOMMODATIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are essentially three levels of accommodation available, with quality equating to their level on Coruscant. Luxury hotels are on the upper levels, start at 500 credits per day for a basic room, and quickly increase in price. Hotels with names such as The Imperial provide almost any service to the wealthier beings of the galaxy. Aliens are unwelcome here, and privacy is obtained only through bribery. In the mid levels, chain establishments such as Sleep Center are tolerant of alien guests, and their upscale rooms start at 200 credits per day. Finally, in the lowest levels of Coruscant, rooms generally start at 100 credits per day, though meager accommodations may be found for 50 credits per day. In either case, security is poor, aliens are common, and establishments such as Gert’s Low Street Hostel take little interest in its guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TRANSPORTAION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes likely will want to use their own airspeeder. If they didn’t bring one along, they may rent one for 300 credits per day or buy one for 10,000 credits. When flying through Coruscant, they must stick to established traffic lanes or draw the attention of the traffic patrol.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through the course of their investigation, they should discover that obtaining a “Class III Restricted” transponder would allow them to legally roam free of the skylanes in all but the military and most restricted areas of the planet. Of course, it is difficult to acquire such a transponder. Their best bet is to try to find one in the lower levels from Eetoa Ro or another shady agent (DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check, the DC for characters who have contacts on Coruscant is reduced by 10). The starting bid for the device is 30,000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alternative transport may be found in the form of taxis or personal transport services starting at 50 credits an hour. Public mass transit is the most economical and slowest option and includes speeder buses, sliding sidewalks, tube trams, and high-speed speeder trains. Weekly passes start at 200 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-hoc XP Award: If the characters acquire a Class III transponder, they receive experience equal to defeating a CR 12 encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONTACTING TERO RESKAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the first things the heroes should do is contact Tero Reskan. When they call the comlink code given to them by Captain Verana, an automated response asks them to leave a message. Once they do so, Tero returns the call but does not offer the secret sign. Instead, he waits for the heroes to say it (“We broke our droid”) and follows it up by giving the countersign (“I hope you meant to”). He then insists on meeting the heroes in person at a location of their choosing. He does not accompany them during the investigation, as he has other affairs to attend to, but he is available when needed for information.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tero is a short, older, dark-skinned Human male with long white hair and a short trimmed beard. He is familiar with all levels of Coruscant and has contacts scattered around the planet. He looks at home in almost any setting. He wears a reversible cloak and carries a short cane, which he can alter to appear as a symbol of high Coruscant fashion (for when he visit the upper levels) or as a cheap stick (for when he is on the lower levels). His mannerisms also change subtly depending on his audience. He despises the Empire, blaming them for nationalizing his interstellar shipping business that used to run to the Deep Core and forcing him out. Use Tero to hint at other avenues of investigation when the heroes get stuck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FOLLOWING LEADS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each major lead is summarized below. Some may be achieved through the use of ability checks and require the heroes to search out certain contacts or locations. Visiting some levels of the city triggers certain encounters. See the encounter “No Aliens” when the heroes investigate the upper levels. Similarly, see “Rodian Fuming” when they go to the lower levels of the factory sector known as the Works.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Failed ability checks or indiscreet investigations may alert the Imperials. Given the variety of methods the heroes may employ, you must judge if immediate Imperial involvement is warranted. Use the encounter “Rapid Response Force” when immediate force is required; run it at least once during the adventure. General triggers are listed below, and specific triggers are listed in the ability checks included with each lead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contacts: Heroes working with their own established contacts should not fear betrayal to Imperial authorities. However, there is always the possibility that an informant works with their contact, so the heroes should be discreet. Contacts can warn the heroes if they are not keeping a low profile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Force: Lesser uses of the Force, especially those out of public view, normally pass without notice. Using the Force around the Imeici Spire may attract the attention of the Inquisitors (see below).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gather Information: Failing Intelligence (Investigation) checks tips off an Imperial informant. Failing a check by 5 to 10 results in low-level suspicion among those from whom the hero attempts to gain information. Multiple failures at this level, or a single failure of more than 10, eventually alerts the ISB, which assigns an agent (use the agent from “Imperial Pursuit, Part 1”) to follow the characters. If the agent observes highly suspicious activity, he calls in an Imperial patrol (triggering the “Rapid Response Force” encounter). Observant heroes should get a chance to notice and deal with the agent before he takes action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Technology: The use of technology does not attract attention unless the characters devise a method of active surveillance or scanning that may be detected or observed. For instance, using sensors to scan a government building will alert Imperial systems, and a squad of Coruscant troopers are dispatched to the area to investigate immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use Computer: The public computer network on Coruscant is one of the most heavily monitored in the galaxy. Imperial government and military networks are notoriously difficult to slice. In either case, if the heroes fail an Intelligence (Technology) or Intelligence (slicer's kit) check by 5 or more when attempting to slice a hostile computer or fail by 10 or more when attempting to slice an indifferent computer their connection is isolated and unusable for 24 hours. An ISB agent (use the agent from “Imperial Pursuit, Part 1”) and a squad of stormtroopers are sent to investigate within 10 minutes (or within 5 minutes in a public place). Failing checks to access specific information will not trigger alerts unless multiple failures on a given subject are detected within an hour or from a single location over the course of a day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Access Point Computer Attitude</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Public terminal (including hotels, etc) Indifferent</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Public terminal with Imperial code cylinder Friendly</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Imperial terminal Hostile</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Imperial terminal with code cylinder Indifferent</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ISB AGENT LESAN DOS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Basics: Dos is an up and coming mid-level ISB agent. He uses his prestigious ISB position to intimidate his targets. He is best known for “exposing” so-called alien plots to influence the Imperial Senate. It is widely believed by anti-Imperial activists that his investigations are at best massive distortions of the truth and at worst outright fabrications, but they are very effective in eliminating or arresting political dissenters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Secrets: The truth is a little of both, especially when he arrests bureaucrats for discovering too much about matters related to the Sarlacc Project. Agent Dos’s priority is to prevent the discovery of the Sarlacc Project by the Senate or anyone else. As such, he has extensive contact with the Inquisitors, and the access codes to the Imeici Spire are stored in his code cylinder—something the heroes will eventually discover they need to access the building.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dos is brash, arrogant, and prideful. He enjoys using his position and power, and he is much sneakier than some give him credit for. He uses his reputation and visibility to his advantage. Because he has become recognizable in some circles, he uses a stand-in when working undercover to give himself an extra layer of protection. He’s currently working anti-alien leads in the Outlander Club, and he can be found there most evenings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Investigation methods: The heroes can learn about Dos in a number of ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contacts: Tero or another contact can give the basics on Dos because his exploits show up on the local newsnets from time to time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Force: Reaching out through the Force through using a Force power or class feature expose nothing until the heroes meet Dos in person, and by then it will be too late unless they lose him in the chase in the \"Outlanders\" encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gather Information: A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check using generally available sources reveals the basics about Dos (described above) and takes 1d6 hours. A DC 23 check and 5,000 credits in bribes to low-level officials or underworld information brokers reveals that Dos often is found in the Outlander Club in the evenings. The check takes 2d6 hours. When the heroes pursue him to the club, see the encounter “Outlanders”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Technology: There is no way to track Dos through technology, unless the heroes are able to tap into the Outlander security system or otherwise locate and follow him from there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use Computers: On a public system, a DC 16 Intelligence (Technology) check reveals the basics in 10 minutes. A DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check takes 1d6 hours and reveals speculation among low-profile dissidents that Dos is protecting something big, though they don’t know what. The search also turns up a picture of Dos at the Outlander, stashed away in a copy of a defunct city entertainment newsnet, Talkstar One. It turns out that the newsnet was ordered shut down the day after the picture was released in its last update for “security” reasons. On an Imperial network, a DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check reveals Lt. Dos’s investigation of suspected alien dissidents at the Outlander.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PROTOCOL DROID CZ-3T6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Basics: CZ-3T6 is an unremarkable CZ-series communications droid that served for many years in the Republic Senate’s master communications center. 3T was one of hundreds of droids routing and organizing Senate communications of all types. When the Senate was reorganized into the Imperial Senate, the communications center was revamped, and CZ-3T6 was reassigned.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Secrets: 3T now controls the main communications node in Imeici Spire. The droid was selected due to its Senate communications center experience, which it now uses to help cover up the Sarlacc Project and the Inquisitors’ actions in general. There is no way to contact the droid other than at Imeici Spire. The droid is loyal to its masters, and selective memory wipes keep it from developing too much of a personality while allowing it to retain its vast knowledge of senatorial contacts, their habits, and their methods. Getting to 3T isn’t actually required. He is a weakness in the Imperial bureaucracy, and tracking him down will lead the heroes to the spire’s location, which they may deduce is that of the Sarlacc Project. If the heroes seek him out on level 188 of Imeici Spire, he proves to be an efficient, loyal droid that mindwipes itself and the communications node rather than let its information fall into the heroes’ hands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Investigation Methods: The heroes can learn about CZ-3T6 in a number of ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contacts: None of the heroes’ contacts knows 3T.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Force: Reaching out through the Force through using a Force power or class feature reveals nothing about the droid unless the heroes meet it in person, after which any attempt through class feature or Force power will reveal the basics and secrets listed above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gather Information Check: 3T is unknown to available sources. A DC 24 Intelligence (Investigation) check taking 1d6 hours reveals that Republic governmental departments frequently used CZ units, but many were reassigned when newer units were phased in shortly after the Empire’s establishment. Once the name Droid Services is known, a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the location of the company.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Technology: There is no way to track 3T directly through technology available to the heroes. Use Computers: A DC 17 Intelligence (Technology) check reveals the basics in 10 minutes. A DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check that takes 1d6 hours reveals that all CZ units from the Republic Senate were handed over to a government contractor simply named Droid Services for refurbishment and reassignment. A DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check taking 5 minutes reveals that the company is located in the upper levels in the Collective Commerce District, better known as CoCo Town.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Access to Droid Services may be attempted remotely. A DC 20 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check must be made to connect remotely. If successful, the computer treats the hero as hostile. A DC 22 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check can be made to change the computer’s attitude, but failure causes the system to break the connection. Since Droid Services is a commercial (not Imperial) facility, authorities are not alerted unless three attempts are failed. If that occurs, an ISB agent and a squad of stormtroopers are sent 12 hours later to the heroes’ location to investigate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes are able to access a friendly system, a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check reveals that 3T was refurbished at Droid Services and assigned to a government communications node in the Imeici Spire four months ago. Unlike droids reassigned to other government offices, CZ-3T6 was removed from the company’s service contract immediately after delivery, and no further information is available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DROID SERVICES</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes investigate Droid Services in person, they find an enormous, well-kept, multistory industrial building with thousands of droids being refurbished at any given time. Security is tight, with private security patrols backed up by sensor-based alarm systems.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The staff at the Droid Services Customer Satisfaction office is willing to discuss general information about the place and its droids. They will not willingly reveal privileged client information, such as the assignment of specific droids. Such information can be accessed through their computer system, assuming the heroes gain access to a terminal. When the computer is accessed from within the building, it treats all users as indifferent or friendly. In this manner, it is possible to learn all of the information described under Use Computers. (for Protocol Droid CZ-3T6).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RESH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Basics: Resh is one tough Sullustan. Stocky, mean-spirited, and aggressive, Resh was a trusted lieutenant of Darga the Hutt. After Darga’s death, Resh attempted to take control of the Hutt’s organization on Coruscant, but it quickly fell apart. Wanted by both the Empire and Darga’s old enemies, Resh hired himself out as an independent enforcer. Recently, he has dropped from view, leaving some to speculate that he finally found a way to smuggle himself off the planet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Secrets: With the death of Darga and the collapse of his organization, Resh discovered that he had little to no influence, and his Imperial contacts dropped him. Resh became paranoid when an Imperial bounty of 10,000 credits was placed on him a few months ago. He is hiding in the lowest levels of the factory sector known as the Works and searching for someone to smuggle him off the planet through information brokers, primarily Eetoa Ro. They also alert him of anyone looking for him. After the heroes meet Eetoa Ro and attempt to meet with Resh in person, run the encounter “The Works Labyrinth” (page 32), followed by the encounter “Resh’s Warehouse” (page 33).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Resh communicated with the Sarlacc Project through a droid at a specific commlink number, but the link has been disabled. He knows that the ISB actively hides the project, partially through Agent Lesan Dos, who has considerable access. He also knows that Darga once told him that the entire operation was to move into a new building called Imeici Spire, now under construction in CoCo Town. He bets that Agent Dos has access to the building with his code cylinder. Resh believes the project is run by a secret Imperial department, but he doesn’t know who it might be. If the heroes ask about Inquisitors, he says the only one he ever knew about was Valin Draco, but he fears that others may find him. He will not help the heroes enter the building and refers all requests for other materials or contacts to Eetoa Ro. He wants nothing to do with the project and wants to get the heroes away from him as soon as possible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Investigation methods: The heroes can learn about Resh in a number of ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contacts: After 24 hours of investigation, a contact in the Coruscant underworld directs them to information broker Eetoa Ro.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Force: Reaching out through the Force through using a Force power or class feature can't locate Resh directly. However, if the attempt is focused on Darga the Hutt, the heroes see a scene from the past: The Hutt is speaking with Resh in person and directing him to establish a safehouse in Commerce Guild Warehouse NW-99c, a long-abandoned warehouse in the Works district. If the attmempt is focused on one of Resh’s information merchants reveals the merchant receiving Resh’s direct commlink code from the Sullustan personally, along with instructions to find someone who can smuggle Resh off the planet. Once the heroes have met Resh, any attempts through class feature or Force power will reveal reveal the basics or secrets described above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gather Information: A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals all attempts regarding finding Resh must be made on the lower levels of the Works district. A DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check taking 1d6 hours reveals Resh’s basics and the Imperial bounty on him. An additional DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check taking 1d6 hours puts the heroes in contact with information broker Eetoa Ro.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Technology: There is no way to track Resh through technology unless the heroes locate his direct commlink number. With that, they may attempt to track his movements to his commlink. However, to do so, they must gain access to the Works area commlink network, which requires a DC 22 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check to access the network’s controllers remotely, then a DC 25 Intelligence (slicer's kit) to locate Resh. If successful, it shows he is in the Works hideout. If unsuccessful, Imperial authorities are alerted, and a Coruscant Rapid Response Force is sent to the heroes’ location, arriving 5 minutes after the attempt fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use Computers: News and records on Resh are few. A DC 19 Intelligence (Technology) check taking 1d6 hours reveals that a 10,000-credit bounty has been posted by the Empire for capturing Resh dead or alive. It also reveals a local newsnet story reporting a dramatic public shootout between “an unknown Sullustan and a criminal gang” in the lower levels of the Works. The attached video clip shows the Sullustan (presumably Resh) brazenly charging and gunning down a small gang of Humans in just a few seconds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>EETOA RO.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although only in his late teens, the fast-talking, self-confident Eetoa is enormously street smart and has vast knowledge of the Works underworld.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eetoa may be reached by commlink to arrange a meeting. He directs the heroes to the landing platform of the Galaxy IV Coolant Refinery, which has been abandoned for decades. When they arrive at the large, rusty platform, Eetoa appears from behind decrepit equipment and zips up to them on an unarmed, banged-up speeder bike (use the statistics for the Aratech 74-Z, page 176 of the Saga Edition Core Rulebook ). He wears a red and blue flight suit that is faded and torn. He negotiates from the speeder bike while the engine is running. If he feels threatened, he zips off at high speed, using his knowledge of the area to lose his pursuers in the refinery’s tangled pipes and passageways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eetoa is cashing in on both sides. Resh is paying him to arrange passage off the planet; however, Eetoa also charges the heroes 5,000 credits (starting) for information. His attitude begins as indifferent. He tells them that Resh needs a way off the planet, and if the heroes convince Eetoa that they can help (and pay the fee), he gives them Resh’s location at a warehouse hideout deep within the Works Labyrinth (see the encounter “The Works Labyrinth” on page 32). For an additional 500 credits, he’ll also let them know that bounty hunters are looking for Resh.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>EETOA RO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), chaotic neutral</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (heavy combat suit, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 27 (5d8+5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10 (+0) 12 (+1) 13 (+1) 15 (-2) 12 (+1) 11 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Piloting +6, Perception +3, Technology +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Huttese, Sullustan</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tech Casting.

Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) energy damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE IMEICI SPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Basics: The Imeici Spire is a 200-story tower clad in black glass and metal at one end of the high level Crystalline Plaza—or at least, it will be, once completed. Right now, the tower is an exposed framework of alloy and ultracrete structure. It is unusual in that levels seem to be completed from the top down, rather than the bottom up. The upper 14 levels appear almost complete, but only the bottom 5 levels appear to have an exterior skin. The remaining levels are much less finished. The official explanation is that the upper levels had to be completed first to allow for the immediate installation of skylane control and Imperial communications equipment. The spire will house Imperial departments of lesser importance, as well as CoCo Town governmental offices, plus some ISB and COMPNOR offices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Secrets: Although the building will include new offices, it already has specialized facilities specific to the Inquisitors’ needs. Their levels are already in use, exclusively for the Sarlacc Project. The security around the building is relatively discrete for a new Imperial structure, but it is very tight on the Inquisitor levels. However, with some investigation, the heroes should be able to discover the building’s vulnerabilities. See Part 3 for additional information.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Investigation methods: The heroes can learn about the Imeici Spire in a number of ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contacts: Tero Reskan and other contacts know the location of the spire but believe it to be simply a cog in the bureaucratic Imperial machine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Force: Force sensitive characters automatically sense a disturbance in the Force when within half a mile of the building. The Inquisitors’ activities have tainted the tower, adding to the sense of unease felt by many who work on or near the building. Using the Force in this area is very dangerous. The Inquisitors are on constant watch for any remaining Jedi or other Force users and they regularly try to sense Force users in the area. When this occurs (no more than twice a day), Force-sensitive characters in the area must make a DC 22 Wisdom (Deception) or Charisma (Deception) check. If they fail, the Inquisitors become aware of the presence of Force sensitives and are prepared for them when they are encountered later in the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gather Information: A casual investigation reveals the location and basics of the tower in 30 minutes. A DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check, which takes 1d6 hours and requires 2,000 credits in bribes, reveals that many believe the building is to be used for other purposes once construction is complete. Speculation is rampant, but some believe the ISB has something to do with it. The construction workers are sworn to secrecy, but rumors abound about secret deliveries made late at night to the building site. A DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check (along with 5,000 credits in bribes to construction workers) gives the heroes a good description of the building material staging area and some ideas about how to access it. The check also reveals that they must have the proper code cylinder to move through the tower itself, and construction worker cylinders won’t access the completed levels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Technology: Using modified scanners or receivers, the heroes may be able to detect transmissions in the suspected Sarlacc Project frequency range when within 3 miles and line of sight of the building. They must make a DC 30 Intelligence (Technology) check to detect the broadcast; heroes who are proficient in slicer's kits have advantage on this check. Once the heroes detect the transmissions, they may pinpoint the broadcast from the communications array at the top of the spire. The transmission is encoded in a manner completely alien to even the most skilled slicers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use Computers: At a public terminal, a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check reveals the location and basics of the tower in 5 minutes. Schematics and building plans are restricted, as they are with all Imperial buildings. At an Imperial terminal, they can confirm that the ISB is heavily involved with the spire, and they can learn about future plans for completing the remaining levels, but they discover nothing about the upper levels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACCESSING IMEICI SPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Investigating the tower turns up two possible entry points: the upper construction delivery zone at level 185, and the construction HQ at plaza level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes must choose how to enter the spire. They may try to infiltrate the building by disguising themselves. All workers require special passes and only approved speeders are allowed to approach and land. Contacts such as Eetoa Ro and Tero Reskan can point them to Core Craft as the primary contractor and supplier on the project, which enables the heroes to get the required passes and equipment. Ultimately, they will probably choose to land at level 185, which is closer to their final goal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes try to disguise themselves as Imperial agents, stormtroopers, or Coruscant guards, they discover that they must bluff their way past the construction workers if they don’t have the proper codes. They also may be challenged by other Imperials that they meet along the way, risking discovery because they won’t know the proper protocols or current standing orders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note: Completing all investigations should be considered a level-up milestone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AD-HOC EXP AWARD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes who successfully obtain information on the four primary subjects of investigation (ISB Agent Dos, protocol droid CZ-3T6, Resh, and the Imeici Spire) receive experience points equal to defeating a CR 13 encounter for each success (a total of four CR 13 encounters). This is in addition to experience gained from separate specific encounters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2 ENCOUNTERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The various investigation options above can lead to different encounters depending on how the party resolves them and these encounters are listed below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RAPID RESPONSE FORCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter may occur almost anywhere on Coruscant, possibly more than once, when Imperial force is needed immediately. If the incident takes place outside, use the encounter map on the first occurrence, with the heroes near the center of the map. If the encounter is triggered elsewhere or more than once, create your own map to match the circumstances. This force may also be used when backup is called in other encounters or if the heroes attract undue attention.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The encounter begins with the arrival of a rapid response force that has been ordered to investigate a disturbance in the area. If combat is not already in progress when they arrive, the Coruscant Guard Veteran attempts to communicate with the heroes, ordering them to halt and surrender for questioning. If combat is already in progress, the rapid response force dives into the fray. They should arrive by airspeeder. However, if they are responding to an ad-hoc call for help or an interior encounter, they arrive on foot (in this case, replace the airspeeder with one additional Coruscant Guard Veteran).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When either the heroes or Imperials enter the combat area (depending on the exact situation), read or paraphrase the following.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If arriving by airspeeder:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The high-pitched whine of an airspeeder engine suddenly engulfs the area. Within seconds, a battle-gray Imperial speeder swoops in from above, its doors sliding open as it descends. Its guns swivel toward you threateningly as Coruscant Guards jump out, fully armed and battle ready.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If arriving on foot:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You hear the all-too-familiar sound of heavy boots and clattering armor that usually means one thing—stormtroopers! In a moment, the armored troopers appear, but instead of the familiar white and black armor, you see the red and black armor of the dreaded Coruscant Guard!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANT GUARDS (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coruscant Guards are elite stormtrooper units created specifically for police duty on the capital world. They have great authority to search any structure as well as to detain virtually any individual when investigating criminal or subversive activities. The number of Coruscant Guards has grown over the past few years, but they are still seen mainly around important facilities, primarily on the upper and mid levels of the city.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see what must the new type of trooper you’ve heard about: Coruscant Guards. Befitting their unique status, they wear distinctive red and black armor, rather than the typical white stormtrooper armor. They are rumored to be well trained and have broad authority to pursue criminals and enemies of the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANT GUARD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (mesh armor, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 44 (8d8+8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>12 (+1) 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 11 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Wis +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +3, Insight +4, Intimidate +2, Perception +4, Piloting +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack.

The cockpit is fully enclosed, the crew impossible to see through the mirrored canopy. A pair of turrets, one chin mounted, one dorsal mounted, tracks their targets. A large door on each side pops out and slides back toward the aft of the vehicle, revealing the troopers inside, ready for a fight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LAAT/LE PATROL TRANSPORT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Huge construct, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (armor plating)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 105 (10d12+40)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed fly 90 ft.

The side doors pop open just before the speeder reaches the ground, allowing the carried Coruscant Guard to jump out and advance on their enemies quickly. If combat has not started, the pilot attempts to use the weaponry and vehicle’s position to intimidate his opponents.

Combat is likely to draw further Imperial attention. If the fighting or encounter lasts more than 5 minutes without a clear winner, a second speeder or rapid response force shows up. If the heroes are defeated, they risk capture and arrest (at best). In most areas of Coruscant, there should be ample opportunity for fleeing heroes to lose themselves in a crowd or complex corridors or city streets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OUTLANDERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have tracked Lt. Lesan Dos to the Outlander Club (where Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker tracked down Zam Wesell in Episode II). The Outlander is one of many vibrant lower-level clubs in the entertainment district. The heroes have little to go on other than the fact that Dos is carrying out some sort of investigation at the club. This may strike them as odd, since his anti-alien stance would seem to make it nearly impossible to carry out any secret investigation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes should get to the club via airspeeder, preferably one they own or control. They may find parking places on an adjacent street (see Imperial Pursuit, Part 1). When the heroes arrive at the club, they find security keeps a close watch on all doors, and they are encouraged to use the main entrance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the Outlander, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The neon framed entrance to the glitzy Outlander Club gives way to a huge multistory circular room, packed with beings from across the galaxy. Clearly, the Empire’s anti-alien leanings haven’t harmed business here. A large circular bar in the center of the room offers just about any drink you can think of. Huge viewscreens at the perimeter walls show racing and sporting events of dubious legality. Signs indicate that gambling halls and other entertainments are available on the balcony levels above. Five circular turbolifts and adjacent one-person lifts in clear tubes give access to other floors. The place is well lit, loud, crowded, and lively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once inside, allow the heroes to make Wisdom (Perception) checks. A result of 15 or above quickly indicates the variety of legal and illegal entertainment available. A result of 20 or above allows them to spot someone who looks like Lt. Dos, dressed in bright blue civilian clothing, standing at a tall table near the video screens. It’s actually Nonul Weran, the lieutenant’s double and decoy. Lt. Dos is staging a sting operation, trying to draw his non-Human enemies out in the open so he can arrest or eliminate them. As an ISB agent, his presence is not normally tolerated at the club, but he is blackmailing the owners to allow him to carry out his operation. Someday, he hopes to shut the place down, but for now, he uses it for his own schemes. However, he knows that he can’t rely on the club’s security to back him up, so he usually tries to get the attackers outside so he can call in superior numbers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The operation has been underway for some time, with limited success. Nonul plays the part of Dos, having a good time in the club, while the agent, disguised in a breath mask and a worker’s jumpsuit, observes from a balcony above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes don’t spot the decoy right away, they may continue to make Wisdom (Perception) checks while they search the room. Once they approach the decoy, read his text aloud. When the heroes get within 10 feet of Nonul, let them make an additional Wisdom (Perception) check. A result of 15 or higher allows them to notice that he is following three different swoop races on the viewscreens and glancing at his gambling datapad. A result of 20 or higher shows the heroes the location of his two informants that are his immediate backup. A result of 25 or higher also tips them off that this may not be Dos but someone made up to look like him. Grant the heroes advantage on the Wisdom (Perception) check if they have more than the newsnet picture of Dos to go on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NONUL WERAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nonul Weran is an ISB undercover specialist that Dos has manipulated into serving as his double and decoy for this operation. Nonul is comfortable at the Outlander, but on his guard. He’s been attacked entering, leaving, and occasionally even within the club. He mimics Dos reasonably well, though he’s not quite as arrogant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You approach a young adult Human, dressed in a trendy bright blue jumpsuit with white trim. He stands at a table adjacent to the racing betting kiosk, glancing between his betting datapad and a number of viewscreens while he subtly scans the crowd.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NONUL WERAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (combat suit, medium shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 44 (8d10)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8 (-1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 15 (+2) 13 (+1) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Wis +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Deception +4, Perception +3, Persuasion +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 3 (700 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack.

If the heroes attempt to sneak up on him, let him make Perception checks. If they engage him in conversation, he responds arrogantly and goes on about racing until he’s sure they’re really after him. If they directly ask his identity, he claims to be Lt. Dos. Use Nonul's Charisma (Deception) and player's Wisdom (Insight) to guide the conversation. Nonul knows that his only backup is two informants and Dos himself. He goes along with almost any scheme that doesn’t directly threaten him so that he can get the heroes in a position where Dos, the informants, and possibly other backup can arrest them outside of the club. He even leads them out, if needed. If forced to fight, he relies on his blaster, attempting to surprise the heroes with a quick draw. He knows nothing about the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nonul Weran has 500 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ISB OUTLANDER INFORMANTS (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two of Lt. Dos’s most reliable informants mingle with the crowd near the decoy. They gather additional information that might be useful to the lieutenant and provide backup for Dos and his decoy. One is male, the other female. If they are detected by the heroes, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see a young man (woman) leaning against a nearby table, toying with a glass of hazy orange liquid. He (she) is clearly dressed for a night in the club. He (she) seems to be deliberately moving about, keeping people or objects between himself (herself) and Agent Dos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ISB OUTLANDER INFORMANT TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The informants work to conceal themselves as much as possible in the crowd. If the heroes approach the decoy, they begin to move closer, taking up positions at nearby tables in case the decoy needs help. If forced to fight, they rely heavily on their sneak attack. If questioned, they have little to offer beyond the basics of Dos’s sting operation, and they know nothing about the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each informant has 500 credits for a total of 1000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ISB OUTLANDER INFORMANT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (combat suit, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 44 (8d10)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8 (-1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 15 (+2) 12 (+1) 14 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Int +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Perception +3, Stealth +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 3 (700 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

If the informant is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the informant instead takes no damage on a success, and half damage on a fail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The informant deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the informant that isn't incapacitated and the informant doesn't have disadvantage on the roll.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tech Casting.

Dos hides in plain sight behind his breath mask and worn, rumpled jumpsuit. Built into the mask is a commlink tuned to the decoy’s commlink, through which Dos can hear all conversations with Nonul. He can even issue brief orders to Nonul and the informants, if needed. Dos is sneaky but arrogant and overconfident. If the heroes look at him with interest, not just in passing, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see a young humanoid male in a worn and rumpled jumpsuit common to workers throughout the lower levels. Despite his humanoid appearance, he wears a breath mask often worn by visiting species.

Dos will direct and manipulate the situation once the heroes contact the decoy or one of the informants. He will order his conspirators to go along with whatever plan the heroes propose, within reason, and encourage them to find an excuse to get the heroes outside into the alleyway (see Imperial Pursuit, Part 1). If a fight breaks out, Dos uses his talents to help without drawing attention to himself, if possible. He directly engages the heroes once he is in a position to try to lead them outside. If Lt. Dos is discovered at any time, or if he ever hears the Sarlacc Project mentioned, he actively tries to usher the heroes outside, calling for backup along the way. If the heroes observe him directly, allow them to make Wisdom (Perception) checks versus his Charisma (Deception) check to attempt to penetrate his disguise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lt. Dos will not go quietly and tries to avoid capture, even fighting to the death. However, if the characters succeed in capturing him, they may quiz him on the Sarlacc Project. He will resist as long as possible and isn’t willing to give up information on the project he works so hard to keep secret. However, if the characters figure out a way to get it out of him, he reveals that his code cylinder allows access to the Imeici Spire up to level 189. He can give the heroes a basic rundown of the building, but he actually knows few details beyond the layout.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lesan Dos carries 1000 credits, a code cylinder that grants access to Imeici Spire up to level 189 and a mask that has a built in commlink.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ultimately, the heroes should encounter the decoy and the informants, likely struggling with them or encouraging them to go outside. Any fight that breaks out inside the Outlander is allowed to continue for 5 rounds before security demands that they take it outside. However, security will not directly get involved in the fight, not wanting to risk harm to save the hated ISB agent and his companions. The crowd will clear the area and become a hazard to the heroes (see the Features of the Area sidebar). If the agents manage to get the heroes outside, (by deception or by baiting the heroes into chasing them out the door), use the map from Imperial Pursuit, Part 1 to continue the encounter. However, the Imperials from that encounter don’t arrive until the heroes have a chance to deal with Dos and the others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-Hoc EXP Award: For chasing down Lt. Dos, the heroes should receive experience points equal to defeating a CL 1R encounter. For acquiring his code cylinder, they should receive experience equal to defeating a CR 12 encounter. Finally, for dealing with the crowd, the heroes should receive experience equal to defeating a CR 10 encounter (reduce this award if they were not careful with the bystanders). All of these awards are in addition to the standard experience points awarded for this encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The club is crowded, and the lower floor is filled with patrons constantly moving about or standing in groups, talking, watching the viewscreens, or drinking. As such, the crowd provides appropriate cover for characters to take the Hide action. For the encounter map, include approximately 15 extra people, scattered around the room. If a fight breaks out, the crowd tries to clear the area, but many get in the way. While this occurs, treat any combatants as though they have half cover. Additionally, an attack that is a critical fail strikes a viewscreen, piece of furniture, or member of the crowd. The heroes may attempt to clear the crowd more quickly by utilizing skills or non-lethal methods</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL PURSUIT, PART 1</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One way or another, the heroes end up in an alley outside the Outlander Club, with or without Lt. Dos, his decoy, and the informants. If they are here with any of those characters, allow the heroes to finish dealing with them before beginning this encounter. The heroes may be anywhere in the area but preferably are near the club door when this encounter starts. The first thing they may see is a nearby surveillance droid attempting to observe the action without them noticing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When ready to begin, have the heroes make Wisdom (Perception) checks versus the surveillance droid’s Dexterity (Stealth) check. If they see it, read its read-aloud text first, then read the following 2 rounds later. If they don’t see the droid, wait about 2 rounds and go ahead with the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you begin to make your way through the alley away from the Outlander, you suddenly hear the unmistakable sound of armored troopers. They appear almost immediately, several stormtroopers led by a uniformed ISB agent. The agent spots you and yells “All of you, halt now !”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One ISB agent and five stormtroopers initially arrive on foot from the direction of the main entrance. The skirmish should go quickly, since the stormtroopers are outmatched. During the fight, allow the heroes to make occasional Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice the droid, if needed. When 4 Stormtroopers have died, an LAAT/le drops from above, filled with five more stormtroopers and another agent. It drops off the troopers and agent, then attempts to cut off fleeing heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FSD-6D FLYING SURVEILLANCE DROID (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The FSD-6D is a common Imperial surveillance droid, used wherever general surveillance is required for law enforcement and lesser military operations. It is fast, observant, and well programmed in surveillance and stealth techniques. Most of its sensors are mounted on its spherical body, but one sensor pack is mounted on a 3-foot extendable stalk that allows the droid to look around corners.

If they flee on foot, the surveillance droids give chase. If the heroes leave by speeder, the droids show up one at a time over 3 or 4 rounds along the way, shortly after they take off.

Losing the patrol transport is difficult, as central control can update each pilot with reports from hundreds of traffic sensors.

However, once they shake all pursuers, they are in the clear—as long as they do not stay in the air very long afterward. If the heroes shake the droids too easily, one or two others may engage later in the chase.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-hoc XP Award: For dealing with the skylane hazards, the heroes should receive experience points equal to defeating a CR 8 encounter, in addition to experience awarded for defeating or evading the pursuing droids and speeders. If the heroes deal with more than five hazards, increase the CR defeated by at least 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use the following hazards and features as the heroes follow their desired path through Coruscant airspace.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Building Shields: Coruscant buildings are typically protected from errant airspeeder traffic by force fields. The buildings adjacent to busier skylanes have shields that are constantly engaged, while buildings farther from the traffic patterns have shields that are activated only at the last moment before a crash. In either case, the shields have a partial cushioning effect to minimize damage to the speeder. Any collision that happens only deals half damage to the speeder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Crowded Skylane: Busy skylanes pose a hazard to speeders traveling at a much greater rate of speed or in a different direction. These vehicles are mobile hazards and require a DC 21 Intelligence (Piloting) check to avoid a large vehicle or a DC 23 Intelligence (Piloting) for a huge vehicle (GM's choice.) On a failed check, the airspeeder scrapes across another vehicle taking 5 (1d10) kinetic damage for a large vehicle or 11 (2d10) kinetic damage for a huge vehicle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exhaust Vent: A massive exhaust vent spews a huge jet of steam into the air. This provides full cover for speeders passing through or along the jet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>High-Speed Dive or Ascent: High-speed dives or climbs typically are not allowed on Coruscant, as they are extremely dangerous and run counter to the skylane patterns. Passing through a skylane in this manner increases the chances for a collision, increasing the DC of an Intelligence (Piloting) check made to avoid a collision by 2 (See Crowded Skylane above)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Light Beams: Extremely bright beams of light shine up from the lower levels or from a nearby building. These beams do not cross a major skylane; however, speeders traveling in open airspace may encounter them. When crossing through a beam, there is a chance that the pilot could be blinded temporarily. This also applies to any character who can see directly out of the front windscreen. The pilot of a vehicle must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw and on a failed save becomes blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skybridge: Skybridges, pipes, and other hazards that span the space between buildings require DC 18 Intelligence (Piloting) checks to navigate, a failed save dealing 22 (4d10) kinetic damage as the speeder collides with such a hazard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skytunnel: Skytunnels allow speeders to pass through massive buildings and are treated as crowded skylanes (see above). Building shields protect the sides of the tunnel (see above).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speeder Truck Convoy: The heroes may attempt to hide among a passing convoy of massive airspeeder trucks or bulk freighters descending from orbit, or they might use the convoy as cover. If attempting to hide, the pilot must make an Intelligence (Piloting) check, opposed by the pursuer’s Wisdom (Perception) check. Additionally, a collision in the convoy may trigger a chain reaction accident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Surface Power Coupling: If the heroes wish to attempt to use a substation power coupling against their pursuer (as Zam did against the Jedi in Episode II), they must first descend to the same level as the coupling, then make a successful ranged attack against the coupling (AC 20). The resulting charge forces any pursuing vehicle and its occupants to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage, taking half damage on a success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE WORKS LABYRINTH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Works Labyrinth is a sprawling tangle of ancient, decayed machinery, enormous pipelines, holding tanks, and catwalks. Clouds of noxious gases leaking from the area make travel very hazardous. The heroes must traverse this zone via airspeeder to reach Resh’s hidden warehouse hideout.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the coordinates of Resh’s warehouse and see the labyrinth for the first time, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Following the coordinates you received, you soon approach an area several kilometers square that appears to be a massive tangle of pipes, machinery, tank farms, and decaying structures. Ominous clouds of noxious colored fumes and smoke encase the area in an unhealthy fog. Your navigation charts indicate that the building you’re looking for is in the deepest levels of the area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the heroes know the location of the building, they must find a path through the labyrinth, a task made more difficult by a number of hazards. Have the heroes make a DC 22 Intelligence (Technology) or a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check to locate a likely entry point using sensors, maps, and visual observation. Success leads them into the middle of the labyrinth; failure allows them to enter the labyrinth, but the path ultimately deadends in a tangle of pipelines, forcing them to exit and try again. When the heroes first enter the labyrinth and its surrounding cloud, they encounter the toxic atmosphere hazard (see Features of the Area).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In each section of the labyrinth, each failed attempt takes 6 rounds to complete, and a successful attempt takes 4 rounds (assuming that nothing causes the heroes to turn back sooner). If the players decide to take the Dash action, it will cut the time in half but it also increases the chances of striking an obstruction (see Features of the Area).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once they reach the middle of the labyrinth, the heroes must make a DC 22 Intelligence (Technology) or a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check to find a way to descend into the lower labyrinth. All heroes who can see out or who have access to a navigation system or sensors may combine actions to aid in this effort through the Help action. Once again, failure leads to a dead end, forcing them to return to the middle labyrinth and start again. Each time they enter the middle labyrinth, they encounter the dense smoke hazard (see Features of the Area). As the heroes exit the smoke in the lower labyrinth, they are immediately attacked by the power coupling hazard (see Features of the Area).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The labyrinth is filled with dangerous hazards. Each of the following occurs as noted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Toxic Atmosphere Hazard: The toxic air of the upper labyrinth is hazy but not dense enough to provide concealment or hinder vision. Each round the heroes spend in the toxic atmosphere, have the players make a DC 15 Constitution check, if a player fails hero takes 4d10 poison damage and gains a level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the players only take half damage. Heroes who wear a breath mask or similar apparatus or who have a self-contained air supply suffer no ill effects. Most fully enclosed airspeeders do not have sufficient filters to block out the atmosphere, but closing the vents cuts the frequency to one every two rounds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dense Smoke Hazard: The dense smoke of the middle labyrinth obscures vision, provides concealment, and is toxic to breathe. Heroes take damage similar to the toxic atmosphere hazard above, but the save is instead DC 17. Creatures and objects within 60 feet are considered to be lightly obscured while anything beyond that is considered to have total cover.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Factory Power Coupling Hazard: As the heroes exit the smoky middle labyrinth, they fly too close to a massive malfunctioning power coupling. A huge electrical charge attacks their speeder, have the speeder and every creature inside it make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw dealing 4d10 Lightning damage on a failed save. Creatures that succeed on the save only take half damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Obstructions Hazard: Massive pipes, structures, and other obstructions make flying through the labyrinth more dangerous. On each attempt to penetrate each section of the labyrinth, the pilot must make a DC 19 Intelligence (Piloting) check to avoid obstructions. Moving at half speed reduces the check to DC 16, while dashing increases it to DC 25. A failed check indicates a collision, which deals 2d10 kinetic damage to the speeder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes make it through the power coupling hazard, the smoke quickly dissipates, and they may fly to the warehouse without further difficulty. The warehouse is at the lowest level and has a landing pad on the roof. See the encounter “Resh’s Warehouse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-hoc XP Award: For finding the correct path for the labyrinth, the heroes should receive experience points equal to defeating a CR 12 encounter. For dealing with the toxic atmosphere, they should receive experience equal to defeating a CR 7 encounter. For dealing with the dense smoke, they should receive experience equal to defeating a CR 10 encounter. And for dealing with the power coupling hazard, they should receive experience equal to defeating a CR 11 encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RESH'S WAREHOUSE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Resh’s warehouse is an ancient, bunkerlike structure in the depths of the Works Labyrinth. A lake of a black, oil-like substance surrounds the structure, and the primary way of entry is through the landing platform on the warehouse roof. The heroes should land at the platform and make their way into the warehouse to find Resh.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the warehouse, they see another large airspeeder that crashed and skidded across the platform. Bounty hunters have come to get Resh, but their speeder was damaged by the power coupling from the previous encounter. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The warehouse appears to be an ancient, bunkerlike structure with a hardened exterior that is pitted and beginning to crumble. The building and other structures in the area are surrounded by a gurgling oil-like substance, which is leaking from nearby storage tanks the size of large buildings. Compared to the air above, the atmosphere at this level is relatively clear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On top of the warehouse, you see a large landing platform with massive cargo lifts. You also see a large airspeeder that recently crash-landed onto the platform, skidded into one of the cargo lifts, and is still smoking. You do not see anyone moving about.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is more than ample room for the heroes to land. They may investigate the smoking speeder, but it is almost consumed in the flames and sending more smoke into the air. They see no signs of bodies or markings on the speeder. The cargo lift it is on is damaged beyond use. The other cargo lifts and turbolifts do not respond and appear to have no power. The only way into the warehouse is through a staircase at one end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes descend the stairs, have them make a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) checks. Those who pass hear distant voices, as if from a heated conversation outside the base of the staircase, but they can’t make out any details. Once the heroes make it to the mezzanine level at the bottom of the stairs, they can hear what appears to be an argument between a Sullustan and a Devaronian speaking Huttese. The Devaronian is demanding the Sullustan’s surrender. If the heroes take a moment to listen to the conversation, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You hear a Devaronian yell, as if calling to somebody some distance away, “Come on, Resh, enough games! You’ve already cost me one speeder and made us fly into this stinking hole. I’m about to forget that the bounty is higher to take you alive. Seems like it will cost me less in the long run to shoot you now.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite the talk, Sisla, the Devaronian bounty hunter, would prefer to take Resh alive. As the heroes move away from the stair door, they can better see their surroundings. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You exit the stair on a mezzanine made of decaying heavy metal grating. Through the grate, you see the same ominous black liquid you saw outside covering the floor of the warehouse to an unknown depth 10 meters below you. The mezzanine is filled with old crates and boxes in various states of disintegration. The lighting is very dim, with only scattered light fixtures and the occasional beam of light peeking in through a discolored window. The ceiling appears to be at least 30 feet above you, but it is lost in darkness. Through the crates, you can make out two more catwalks extending through the roof trusses from the mezzanine out into the warehouse. The argument seems to be taking place at the other end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes cross the mezzanine, have them make Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the passive perception of the bounter hunters. Additionally, the bounty hunter's should make Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the player's passive Perception, as two are concealed within the stacks of crates near the catwalks. The area is considered to be in dim light for the purposes of Wisdom (Perception) checks. If they detect the heroes and are close enough, the hunters engage in melee; otherwise, they open fire with their blasters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Their leader, Sisla, is at a platform at one end of the catwalks, arguing with Resh, who is on a separate, higher platform. The only way up to the platform appears to be to climb the structure supporting it from each catwalk, and a bounty hunter is climbing up from each catwalk while Sisla forces Resh to keep his head down. The platform is 15 feet above the catwalks and requires a DC 17 Strength (Athletic) check if the climber lacks a climbing speed. If a climber fails the check, they fall into the black oil covering the floor below but takes no damage. Anyone in the oil can use their action to reach a piece of debris or crate large enough to support themselves if they do not possess a swim speed. When the heroes arrive, the climbing hunters are half way up the ladder and will need to make another check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the bounty hunters are aware of the heroes, they open fire, trying to keep one eye on the heroes and one eye on Resh. The Sullustan initially keeps his head down, but if it appears that the heroes are winning, he takes potshots from the platform at the bounty hunters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SISLA'S HUNTERS (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sisla’s hunters are a group of Devaronians out for some adventure while making a few credits. They have traced Resh for too long to give him up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Devaronians wear worn gray armor that has seen a lot of action. Each appears to carry an array of weaponry, including a vibro-ax, a blaster rifle, and something that looks suspiciously like grenades.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SISLA'S HUNTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Devaronian), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (composite armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 93 (11d8+44)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 12 (+1) 18 (+4) 11 (+0) 11 (+0) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +6, Con +6, Wis +2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Intimidation +5, Survival +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Poison</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Binary, Bocce, Devaronese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aggressive.

The two climbing hunters attempt to reach Resh’s platform. Even if they do, they won’t be able to get the Sullustan immediately, since he has locked himself in an armored room and is firing at the hunters through a gunport. At this point, one hunter turns and opens fire on the heroes while the other returns fire at Resh, just to keep him busy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each hunter carries 100 credits each for a total of 400 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SISLA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sisla is a tough bounty hunter unafraid of chasing his quarry to any planet in the galaxy, including Coruscant. He leads a group of other Devaronians in a life of adventure. His pursuit of Resh has cost him more credits than the bounty may be worth, but he’s not about to give up now. He’s also not about to let someone else get away with his bounty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SISLA TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once Sisla is aware of the heroes, he opens fire, yelling that they won’t steal his bounty. He initially uses Double Attack. If he can’t hit the heroes, he tries to blow holes in the catwalks around them, hoping to drop them through. He does not climb after Resh until the fight is over.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sisla carries 2000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SISLA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium Humanoid, lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (heavy exoskeleton)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 98 (15d8+30)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15 (+2) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +7, Int +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +8, Stealth +5, Technology +11, Perception +5, Survival +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Poison</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Binary, Bocce, Devaronese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (2,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Enhanced Tech.

When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the disruptor rifle, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Techblade Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

On a fail the creature will have its speed halved until the end of your next turn. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RESH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Resh is an older male Sullustan, bare-armed and muscular in appearance.

However, if they appear to be winning, he joins in by laying prone on the platform and firing down at the bounty hunters. He retreats to the safety of his armored room if anyone reaches the platform, firing at them from a gunport.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unable to get to Resh while the heroes are interfering, the hunters fight to the end. Once the hunters are dealt with, the heroes must make their way up to Resh and convince him to tell them about the Sarlacc Project. He is astonished that anyone else knows about it. Offering him a way off the planet is the best method of getting him to open up. Unless the heroes convince him that they have a way off Coruscant, Resh stays in his armored room until they leave. He will not go with them to the spire or anywhere else.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-hoc XP Award: Heroes should receive experience points equal to defeating a CR 13 encounter for rescuing Resh from the bounty hunters.

Each 5 foot square of plating has a DR of 10. Any damage that bypasses the DR causes a 5 foot sized hole in the surface or railing as the catwalk gives way. Focusing fire on a single area could damage a catwalk enough to separate it or even drop a section into the oil-covered floor below. Some railings are weak enough to collapse under the weight of fighting characters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The black oil is not immediately hazardous, but it coats anyone who falls into it. Until they use an action wipe the oil off their hands and feet, it imposes disadvantage on attacks, Strength checks and Dexterity checks, and halves their movement. Several damaged ladders lead from the oil-covered floor back up to the catwalks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: SPIRE OF DARKNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Infiltrating an Imperial government tower (even an incomplete one) on the capital world of the Empire should be an intimidating task. If the heroes fail and are captured, it is likely that they will be interrogated and sent to an Imperial prison planet; Tero Reskan should remind them of this possibility. Although tower construction continues at all hours, there are somewhat fewer workers in the building overnight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Upon completion, the spire will have levels as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Level 200 Communications array</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 195–199 Security surveillance array</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 190–194 Skylane traffic control equipment</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Level 189 Restricted (Inquisitor level, incomplete)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Level 188 Restricted (Sarlacc Project, incomplete)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 186–187 Restricted (communications node, incomplete)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Level 185 Upper construction delivery zone/hangar level</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 151–184 ISB local offices</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 126–150 Imperial information offices</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Level 76–125 COMPNOR local offices</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 2–75 Collective Commerce District government offices Plaza level Main entry and lower construction HQ</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevels 1–10 Building support services</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevel 2 Service entry</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevels 11–15 Restricted (speeder tube station)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevel 16 Building security</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevel 17–20 Utility supply links and emergency power station</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once prepared, the heroes depart for the tower. Their exact approach depends on the entrance selected. If they are making the trip by airspeeder, the trip is uneventful until they drop from the skylane into an approach vector. At that point, a Human voice from tower construction control demands that they state their destination and transmit their permit to land. The heroes don’t know it, but all permits have been changed since they acquired their permit. However, if they monitor the construction traffic, they find that they are not the only ones. All speeders without the correct permit are put into a holding pattern orbiting the spire. One by one, they are allowed to approach. The heroes must persuade the controller to let them land with a DC 20 Wisdom (Persuasion) check. If they fail, they may try again, but for each subsequent attempt, the DC increases by 5. Once approval is given, the heroes are told they must wait for 60 minutes and to stay in the pattern. Additional DC 20 Wisdom (Persuasion) checks may earn them permission to land within 10 minutes</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes arrive on foot, they arrive at the enormous Crystalline Plaza, which, true to its name, is dotted with intricate crystal sculptures and structures from around the galaxy. Beyond that, the plaza’s main use is as a public thoroughfare and transit stop. The ominous spire looms over the plaza. Pairs of Coruscant Guards patrol the area at widely dispersed intervals, requiring the heroes to make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) checks; failure means that a pair of guards questions their activities. The heroes may attempt to persuade the guards into letting them continue about their business. If they fail, the guards try to drive them from the plaza with their staffs, thinking that the heroes are run-of-the-mill troublemakers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the tower, characters can make DC 20 Intelligence check and if they are proficient in constructor's tools, they may add their proficiency bonus to the check. Success means that they notice that the building employs a construction technique using prefabricated rooms. Entire rooms could be completely fitted out in a factory in advance, then added to the massive superstructure without anyone observing what is inside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read or paraphrase the following when the heroes approach the spire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you approach the spire, you see that the upper stories appear almost complete. Several levels at the base are also enclosed, but the vast majority of the tower is only a skeletal structure, with elevator cores and other shafts connecting the floors. The tower is octagonal, with wedge-shaped towers at every other side, extending to become a complex antenna array above the top floor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dozens of workers and construction droids work on all levels. White-hot flashes of welding dot the structure, and the bangs and whines of construction tools and machinery are loud enough to penetrate your speeder’s cabin. A variety of speeders and equipment sit on the hangar deck you are approaching, and a construction worker directs you to the proper landing place. Once you are down, the tough-looking Human points you to the superintendent’s office and moves on to his next task.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-hoc XP Award: Heroes who successfully enter the spire receive experience points equal to defeating a CL 12 encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE CONTROL ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All incoming personnel are directed to the control room. Fortunately for the heroes, they are the only ones arriving for some time. Although it is assumed that the heroes enter the tower at level 185, the encounter may be used at the plaza entrance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have been directed to the control room. Upon entering, the construction techs expect the heroes to coordinate their activities through them. The heroes need to access the computer system and gain access to the spire itself. All the techs are at their control stations. Two senior techs are at the central holographic projector, and the third, Celor Teon, approaches the heroes when they enter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the control room from the hangar, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You enter the construction control room. Six techs work at stations around the room, many talking with workers in the field via comlink. Most of the computer screens and holoprojectors show schematics of various levels, plus the speeders in the local air traffic pattern. Three older and tougher-looking Human techs oversee all activity. One turns to you immediately and says, “Well, what was so important that you had to land this instant? We run the show here, not you. You’re just lucky my assistant allowed you to land. I would’ve let you buzz around this building till your wings fell off!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The unexpected permit changes have thrown the project into disarray, and the entire staff is irritated. No one knows why it was ordered, just that it came from higher up the chain. Although there is a chance that the heroes may talk their way into the building and possibly even gain access to the computer system, the senior techs are sharp. If they suspect that something is up, they move to trigger an alarm to bring in security—which, in this building, means Coruscant Troopers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORE CRAFT CONSTRUCTION TECHS (6)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The construction techs are well trained for their jobs.

If the heroes secure the room, they may access the computer system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Afterward, they may access the rest of the building. If one of the heroes thinks to pick up a construction code cylinder from the senior techs, it gives them access to the construction lift platforms in certain areas of the spire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The control panels and furniture in the room may provide cover. The doors to the turbolift are locked and can be opened only with a construction code cylinder or Dos’s code cylinder. Beyond that, the room has few features.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the encounter, the heroes may access the computer system. They have only about 10 minutes until somebody comes in to take care of business or discover why they lost contact with the control room. If the alarm was raised, a squad of Coruscant troopers arrives in 5 minutes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any check involving the computer in this room is made at DC 21, if the alarm was sounded however the DC is 24 for any check. however, if ISB Agent Dos’s code cylinder is used, it changes the DC to 17. From here, the heroes may obtain a readout and schematic of every floor of the building except levels 186 through 189. The schematics are for the completed structure, so the heroes find that many areas are blocked off or not finished yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Levels 186 to 189 require special authorization for entry. A DC 25 Intelligence (Technology) check reveals that Agent Dos’s code cylinder should grant access to those levels using the turbolifts or stairs. Also, construction repulsorlift platforms on level 185 provide access to the incomplete areas of levels 186 to 189. The platforms do not respond to Dos’s code cylinder, but they will respond to a construction code cylinder or may be hotwired to override their security protocols with a DC 24 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INSIDE THE SPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As long as the building is not in a state of alert, the heroes are free to move about the tower using functioning turbolifts, partially completed stairs, and construction repulsorlift platforms. If the alarm is raised, the turbolifts are locked down, forcing the heroes to take other paths between floors. However, Agent Dos’s control cylinder overrides the turbolift lockdown. There is plenty of construction equipment, cutting torches, and lasers scattered around the building to provide cover and conceal movement. The construction workers and droids will report any suspicious activity they see and flee the area if threatened.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Level 188 is only partially completed. It may be accessed by stairwell, turbolift, or construction lift from the level below. Once the heroes reach the completed section of the level, they ultimately have to force their way in, and when that happens, events move at a rapid pace.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEVEL 188 ENTRY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have made their way to Level 188 and can enter by stair, turbolift, or a door to the unfinished portion of the level. Regardless, they end up in the same entry area. A guard post blocks their path, and the troopers have a surprise for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the antechamber, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You step through the door into a large, octagonal metal room. The walls are stark gray and cold, and light emanates from long, thin fixtures built into the ceiling. Several doors are immediately visible, as is a large viewport through which you see four Coruscant Guards grabbing their weapons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes are dressed as Imperials, the Guards demand (via a speaker in the ceiling) that they identify themselves and give the day’s password (which is “Cresh 273,” though the heroes have no way of knowing that). If the heroes don’t respond appropriately, or if they are not disguised as Imperials in the first place, read or paraphrase the following aloud</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The guard behind the window slams his hand down on a large button. The turbolift controls register lockdown with the doors locked open (or the door to the stair or the door to the outside seals shut). A red gas jets into the room from four nozzles near the center of the ceiling!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The 4 gas nozzles on the ceiling act on initiative 20 and force any creature that starts its turn in the gas or enters the gas for the first time on its turn to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A failed save deals 11 (2d10) points of poison damage and gives that creature a level of exhaustion while a successful save causes the creature to only take half half damage. If all 4 nozzles are destroyed (each gas nozzle has AC 14 DR 15, and 15 hit points). The gas may also be shut off from the security control room with a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes damage the nozzles, the guards open the doors and enter the room. They have special filters built into their helmets to protect them from the gas. The two Coruscant Guard Veterans arrive 2 rounds after the heroes first enter the room, coming down the hallway from the detention block.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes locked out of the room may attempt to reenter by using Dos’s code cylinder (which overrides the lockout) or by making a DC 24 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check to hot-wire the door panel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANT GUARD VETERAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the 'Rapid Response Force' encounter for the Coruscant Guard Veteran description.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANT GUARD VETERAN (6)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 17 (weave armor, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 85 (13d8+26)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>12 (+1) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 16 (+3) 11 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Wis +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +3, Insight +2, Intimidate +2, Perception +5, Piloting +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Imperial Training.

The Coruscant Guard Veteran makes two weapon attacks and throws an electrostun grenade, if available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Blaster Rifle. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8+3) energy damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Electrostaff. Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 5 ft., one target.

The Coruscant Guard Veteran throws a grenade, choosing a point within 35 ft. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Leadership (1/Rest). The Coruscant Guard Veteran can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the Coruscant Guard Veteran. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the guards are defeated, the heroes may proceed down the detention block corridor. The guard station has a simple comm station and security console that controls only the entry area doors and the gas trap. With a DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check, the heroes may use the console to lock the turbolifts (temporarily) and the outer doors in the entry area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEVEL 188 DETENTION BLOCK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the heroes defeat the entry guards, they may proceed down the corridor to the detention block. The block guards had been reinforced by the Coruscant Guard Veterans, but they left to back up the entry guards in the previous encounter. However, there is another surprise for the heroes as they approach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes move about halfway down the corridor to the detention block, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you make your way down the corridor, you see a closed blast door at the end of the hall. Suddenly, two blaster turrets drop from the ceiling on either side of the door and open fire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DETENTION BLOCK TURRET</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium construct, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 17</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 255 (34d8+102)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 0 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16 (+3) 10 (+0) 16 (+3) 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +6, Con +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Perception +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities ion</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances necrotic, poison, psychic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities poison, disease</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 5 (1,800 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Circuitry. The turret has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Imperial Tech. The turret deals an additional weapon die of damage with its Burst Fire action (Included).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Targeting Systems. The turret uses its Intelligence modifier for attacks and damage rolls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack. The turret makes two Burst Fire attacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Burst Fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d12+3) energy damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the turrets are defeated and the heroes get through the blast door (see Features of the Area), the guards have one last surprise for them. When the first hero steps through the door, three ray shields divide the corridor into sections as indicated on the map, hopefully trapping the heroes between them. However, the first hero or two should be trapped in the detention block, allowing the guards to open fire using readied actions. Read or paraphrase the following aloud when the heroes enter the detention block.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You enter an octagonal room with a central control station. In each wall except the one you entered through, there is a door next to a window, allowing you to see into cells and interrogation rooms. Five cells hold a number of Humans and other beings. Two interrogation rooms are dark except for tiny colored lights from some sort of equipment and computers. You have little time to look, though, as the remaining guards open fire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The shields may be lowered in one of several manners. First, a hero in the detention block may use the Search action to make a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which panel controls the shields, then destroy it an successful attack that deals at least 10 points of damage or deals ion damage. Alternatively, the hero may simply turn off the shields with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check. In addition, the trapped heroes may make a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to realize that they can defeat the shields by attacking the projectors and the walls, which have AC 19, DR 10, and 15 hit points. However, misses cause energy damage to ricochet off the shields, endangering those trapped within. Roll a ranged weapon attack with a bonus of +6 to hit a creature inside that section of the shield, if it hits the attack does normal weapon damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DETENTION BLOCK GUARDS (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Four slightly better-than-average Imperial detention block guards monitor the prisoners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Beyond the blast door, you see four Imperial detention block guards, blasters in hand, wearing distinctive blast vests and black helmets</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PRISON BLOCK GUARD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium construct, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 68 (15d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10 (+0) 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 11 (+0) 11 (+0) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +2, Perception +2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack. The guard makes two weapon attacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Blaster Carbine. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) energy damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DETENTION BLOCK GUARD TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The guards are outclassed, and they know it. They activate all the corridor defenses, trying to delay the heroes until reinforcements arrive. Once the heroes make it to the detention block controls, the guards use Coordinated Attack in a last attempt to stop them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the guards, shields, and turrets have been defeated, the heroes may search the detention area, free the prisoners, and inspect the computer system. See “Level 188” encounter. If needed, the heroes also may use the medical bay to quickly treat the wounded which can give the benefits of a short rest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the encounters, the heroes discover the surprising truth about the Sarlacc Project. The detention block holds five Humans, two Duros, and one Mon Calamari, in several cells. All prisoners are desperate to escape their rooms, but all except one Duros are delusional. That Duros is in better condition and can answer the heroes’ questions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read or paraphrase the following. If the heroes appear to be Imperials at first glance, the Duros will cower, and the heroes will have to convince the prisoner that they are not part of some Imperial trick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you enter the dimly lit metal cell, a beaten and depressed Duros slowly raises his head from the cold metal slab that serves as a bed. It takes a moment for him to focus, but when he realizes that you are not a guard or Imperial, he immediately jumps to his feet. “Please, you must get me out of here. They are monsters without pity or compassion. I surely won’t last another week here. We must escape before they return to deal with you . . . and us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Duros is named Gelnar Tol, a starship designer who used to work for Kuat before being abducted and brought here about a week ago. He is willing and able to tell the heroes what he knows about the Sarlacc Project (although he doesn’t know the project codename or the names of the other designers). This is the heart of the design team for a massive new starship some 1,600 miles long that will dwarf even an Imperial class Star Destroyer (and is a forerunner of the eventual Super Star Destroyer). However, the project is operating in a manner beyond belief. The designers are held prisoner by the Inquisitors, who use “what must be evil dark side powers” to rip data from the designers’ minds or to turn them into single-minded machines that work on command, unaware of anything else. Gelnar Tol has no idea why the Empire would design a starship in this manner, but he is desperate to escape.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>By accessing the detention area computers and making a DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check which cannot be reduced by code cylinders as the other systems. On a successful check, the heroes discover that the Inquisitors are transmitting the design data through CZ-3T6 and the communications node on level 187. The information goes to messenger drones and other outlets that pass it on to an unknown construction site.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With another DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check, they discover that the Sarlacc Project is the codename for the massive ship, which will serve as the flagship for the new Imperial fleet, as well as a prototype for future vessels. The Empire plans to use it as a weapon of terror and massive mobile weapons platform. The Imperial Navy and the Inquisitorius are working together to secretly build the ship without alerting the Imperial Senate, which would never approve of such a risky design. The project is strictly off the books, so construction supplies are purchased through alternative means (such as the Tibanna gas bought from Darga the Hutt). They are also using Nazren slaves to build the ship. The files include detailed data on the transactions, which would be useful to Senator Organa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do not have time to check the computer system or are unable to access it, a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal that they could simply take the storage array from the control panels in either interrogation room with them and attempt to slice it later. The array is about the size of a small backpack and weighs 7 pounds. It can be removed from the system with a DC 22 Intelligence (Technology) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR ATTACK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have only about 15 minutes after the end of the level 188 encounters before reinforcements arrive in a big way. When the heroes are ready to leave, they discover that the doors out of level 188 are locked down and their code cylinder has been locked out. They can tell from the security screens in the control room that Coruscant Guards are blocking the stairwell and that the lift has been locked on another floor. They also realize that all of the construction workers are evacuating the structure by whatever means they can. The only way out is to break through the door to the incomplete area. They may physically break through the door with a DC 20 Strength check or attempt to open it with a DC 21 Intelligence (Technology) check. If the heroes dally, prod them along by having the computers indicate that many Coruscant Guards are advancing up the stairwells. However, the guards are only there to keep the heroes from escaping. The Inquisitors are coming to take care of the problem personally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes must cut through the door leading to the construction zone or override the lock with tools and a DC 30 Mechanics check. Once they get through, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you enter the construction area, you see stacks of crates and piles of materials such as enormous metal beams and metal plating. Directly ahead, some distance away, you see one of the major staircases of the building. Along the way to the stairs are several doors that lead into the unfinished rooms of this level. You also see two open-sided construction lifts, but neither is stopped at this level. Much of the exterior of this level is unfinished and open, with only a railing providing protection from a great fall. A cold wind whips through the open areas, scattering debris and dust.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes get about halfway to the staircase, have heroes trained in Use the Force make an opposed Sense Force roll. Someone (one of the Inquisitor apprentices) is attempting to detect them, and the heroes can try to hide their presence. If the heroes attempt Sense Force in turn, all Inquisitors will resist detection. If the heroes succeed, they detect the approximate direction of that Inquisitor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Immediately thereafter, have the heroes make DC 20 Perception checks to notice that one construction lift is lowering very quickly while the other is rising abruptly. (They notice automatically if they are watching the lifts.) If they notice, read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The construction lifts suddenly begin to move very quickly, one dropping from above, the other rising from the floor below. On each lift is a Purge Trooper and a Human who is dressed in black and holding an ignited red lightsaber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inquisitor Nolor appears at the stairway entrance after the first round of combat. See their Tactics sections for specific attack methods in the first few rounds of combat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter should be as cinematic as possible. The Inquisitors throw construction materials and use Force thrust to try to push the heroes over the edge of the building or through a gap in the floor.

See the “Collapse and Descent” encounter (page 49). Captured Inquisitors are highly dangerous and will not reveal anything useful. They are killed in the building collapse in the next encounter</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The construction zone is littered with building materials of all sizes, including Large-sized long metal beams, Large plates, and smaller materials. There are some welders and cutting equipment as well. There are temporary, widely spaced railings at the building edge and floor openings. They will collapse under the weight of combat and won’t stop someone from slipping under the rail (such as a prone character pushed toward the edge). Characters falling to the level below take 2d6 kinetic damage from the 20 foot fall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a character falls or is thrown out of the building, the automated worker safety system kicks in. Every three floors, a small tractor beam attempts to pluck falling objects or people out of the air. Any creature falling must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the character’s descent is slowed, and he is pulled to the nearest floor of the building. If unsuccessful, the next tractor beam down makes an attempt. If several characters are falling, only one may be rescued per tractor beam, while the others fall to the next beam down. If a tractor beam grabs a character, the creature must also make a DC 15 Constitution save. On a failed save, the character takes 22 (4d10) kinetic damage and takes one level of exhaustion while on a successful save, the creature takes half damage and does not gain a level of exhaustion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>COLLAPSE AND DESCENT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just as the last Inquisitor is about to be defeated, he triggers the building’s self-destruct sequence via comlink, which immediately activates. The fact that the Inquisitors will go to such an extreme to prevent the project’s discovery should inspire awe and fear in the heroes. However, they have no time to discuss it because the building immediately begins to collapse, and they are in no position to escape. It is readily apparent that they will not make it back to their speeder or out of the building in time. Even though it looks hopeless, all is not yet lost.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the building begins to collapse, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Suddenly, you hear many loud explosions from the base of the building. The entire structure begins to shake and rumble, creating massive clouds of dust and debris as it begins to collapse! All around you, the floors buckle and tilt wildly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes must move quickly to save themselves. Any characters proficient in constructor's tools know that the prefabricated rooms on any level may be strong enough to survive the collapse, given how slow it is proceeding. Heroes who make a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check realize the same thing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Creative heroes may attempt to use one of the building’s safety system tractor beams to somehow save themselves or reverse it to provide additional protection. Such attempts require a DC 30 Mechanics check and may reduce the damage caused to heroes, depending on how they use the beams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some heroes may attempt to get down to level 185, hoping to find an airspeeder in the hangar. If they hurry, they may be able to reach that level if they can get past the building hazards (see the Features of the Area sidebar). Unfortunately, only one speeder remains, which the Inquisitors used to get to the spire. Both it and its systems are locked down, and in the time it takes the heroes to break through to start the speeder, the building will have collapsed. However, play up the suspense and danger until the last possible moment, when they must finally run for cover.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the collapse continues, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The noise of the collapse is deafening. Dust obscures your vision, and building materials fly dangerously through the air. Electrical systems spark and flare as they are ripped from their mountings. No matter where you run, you twist and turn to avoid colliding with jagged pieces of debris or flailing electrical wiring.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the collapse, the heroes must deal with a series of hazards. Depending on their exact location at the start of the collapse, they may encounter several hazards. However, before the end of the encounter, they should deal with at least two crushing hazards and two electrical hazards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The collapse takes more than five minutes. When the building finally settles, the heroes may attempt to dig themselves out. Select one or more areas on the map for their final location. If they chose safer prefabricated areas, place them in an intact area. If not, place them in the rubble. The surrounding debris is still quite dangerous, and Imperial aid workers and security began arriving on the scene almost immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The map for this encounter represents the end result after the collapse. Use the map for level 188 or your own map if the heroes are on another level when the collapse begins. As the building collapses, the entire area becomes difficult terrain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Crushing Hazard: During the collapse, debris may fall from above or come from other directions as walls crack and floors buckle. Whenever a character is endangered by such debris, have them make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, on a failed save the creature takes 22 (4d10) kinetic damage. On a successful save, she takes half damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Electrical Hazard: The building’s electrical system is equally dangerous to the heroes because it is shredded in the collapse. Whenever unsecured electrical wiring endangers a character, have them make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, on a failed save the creature takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage. On a successful save, she takes half damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ESCAPE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the collapse of the spire, the entire area becomes a chaotic disaster area. Though the building largely collapsed into the sublevels, much debris has fallen into the Crystalline Plaza, shattering the sculptures and spreading crystal shards across the area. Fortunately, the evacuation of the construction workers and the irregular collapse prevented a greater loss of life. Emergency services and security personnel descend within 10 minutes and begin to search for survivors. If any of the heroes are trapped in a prefabricated room or within the rubble, emergency personnel may dig them out. Otherwise, they must escape the rubble on their own, and once on the “ground,” the heroes must elude Imperial investigators seeking to apprehend them and emergency workers looking to render aid. They must elude at least two Coruscant trooper patrols and at least three aid worker attempts to provide assistance and take down their information. This requires several Charisma (Deception) checks, Charisma (Persuasion) checks, and/or Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Fortunately for the heroes, all the chaos provides ample cover for slipping through the rubble and finding a way out. The heroes may escape the area by commandeering an emergency vehicle or ambulance or through some other method. This provides noncombat characters, leaders, and nobles another chance to talk their way out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Not all of the Sarlacc Project designers are accounted for. Gelnar Tol may or may not have escaped with the heroes, but it is certain that some of the designers were killed in the collapse, while others either escaped or were buried in the rubble. It is impossible for the heroes to discover their fate. The last Inquisitor may or may not be accounted for.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are likely to be reluctant to return to their hotel or ship, as they rightfully suspect that the Inquisitors have identified them. Eventually, they should contact Tero Reskan, who is relieved to discover that they are still alive and quickly comes to pick them up in an airspeeder. He takes them to a safehouse that he uses as a headquarters deep in the warehouses of the Works, far away from CoCo Town.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tero offers to get word back to Senator Organa and even transmit the Sarlacc Project data back to the Resurgence using a pirated Holo-net feed. The heroes are congratulated on their efforts and ordered to stay out of sight and in hiding on Coruscant until Captain Verana and Admiral Varth determine the next course of action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WWW.GMBINDER.COM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This document was lovingly created using GM Binder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you would like to support the GM Binder developers, consider joining our Patreon community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GM Binder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Discover</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Log In</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Register</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Further Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terms of Service</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Us</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS: DAWN OF DEFIANCE EPISODE 7 - A RECKONING OF WRAITHS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AReckoning of Wraiths is the sixth adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, which will take heroes from 1st level all the way through 20th level in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete SW5e experience. In this adventure, the heroes are in hiding on Coruscant, wanted by the Empire for their recent actions against the Inquisitorius (as detailed in the previous adventure, The Core of Corruption). When the heroes are sent to find a Sarlacc Project designer who survived the destruction of the Imeici Spire, they learn—the hard way—that the Empire does not like to be crossed. The heroes should advance to 15th level by the conclusion of the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IS DAWN OF DEFIANCE?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dawn of Defiance is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the adventures in the Dawn of Defiance campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic SW5e experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The Dawn of Defiance campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Dawn of Defiance adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Warning! If you will be playing in a Dawn of Defiance campaign or in a campaign utilizing its adventures, read no further.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CAMPAIGN UPDATE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Reckoning of Wraiths begins mere days after the end of the previous adventure, The Core of Corruption. The heroes remain on Coruscant, safely entrenched with the loyalists in their safehouse. The details of the Sarlacc Project are now in the hands of Captain Verana aboard the Resurgence, and the loyalists are trying to decide what to do next.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes haven’t had much time to get comfortable. The majority of the loyalists are normal folks who do not agree with the Emperor’s politics and have decided to do something about it. They aren’t trained combatants, for the most part, though one or two of the loyalist guards might have some experience in law enforcement (as local police, bounty hunters, or the like).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tensions in the safehouse are high, especially now that the heroes— who are wanted by the Empire—are here. Every caller that comes to the door is examined, and every speeder that passes by on the street is suspect. Despite the worry, the loyalist hosts are congenial and, in some cases, fawn over the heroes. After all, the heroes are nearly legendary due to their prior exploits, and they’ve recently stood up to the Inquisitorius and walked away victorious.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a good opportunity for roleplaying between the heroes and the people who look up to them. Allow the heroes to make friends, share meals, and form friendships with the loyalists. Demonstrate that these people are good and represent everything that the Empire stands against. Give the heroes a reason to care. Later, when the loyalists meet their fate, it will make their deaths more meaningful and reinforce the true evil of their enemies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUMMARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Reckoning of Wraiths opens in the loyalist safehouse on Coruscant, where the heroes wait for the heat from their recent activities against the Inquisitorius to cool down. Within a day of their arrival at the safehouse, Admiral Varth contacts them via a pirated Holonet signal. Against the odds, one of the captive Sarlacc Project designers, an Incom weapons technician named Pavel Trenol, survived the destruction of the Imeici Spire. Seeking asylum, Trenol contacted the loyalists. He is currently laying low in a hotel in Coruscant’s lower levels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Varth instructs the heroes to contact Trenol at his hotel and provides them with a poor quality holo of the technician. They venture into Coruscant’s seedy underbelly, encountering some of its most bestial denizens. When they arrive at the hotel, the heroes find only an empty room registered in the technician’s name. Brief investigations lead them to a cantina, where they are ambushed by Imperial Security Bureau agents.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With nothing more to go on, the heroes return to the safehouse. But while they were gone, Imperial troops descended on the hideout and killed or captured the loyalists. The troops also try to put an end to the heroes, who retreat to the landing pad where their ship is located. Unfortunately, it has been impounded and is guarded by an AT-AT.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes escape Coruscant, they are best served by returning to the Resurgence at the appointed rendezvous. But when they emerge from hyperspace, they find the Resurgence under attack by a large Imperial force. Captain Verana calls for help, leading the heroes to dock with the Resurgence—which has been boarded by stormtroopers—to rescue as many crew as they can. But they can do little when they discover that Inquisitor Valin Draco has captured Jedi Master Denia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once off the Resurgence, the heroes are contacted by Admiral Varth, who is again in full Imperial regalia. He only pretended to defect in an attempt to root out insurgents and now demands that the heroes surrender. Instead, the heroes jump into hyperspace and find their way back to Senator Organa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The encounters \"Ogre Ambush\" and \"A Line of Prisoners\" can be used in the order presented. However, if you want to mix things up a bit, these encounters can occur in any order within their chapters. For instance, \"Ogre Ambush\" takes place as the heroes make their way to the Invisible Hand cantina. But you can spring the encounter after the heroes leave the cantina or as they enter the Gnawer’s Roost, or you can combine it with another encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS : DAWN OF DEFIANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Episode VII: A Reckoning of Wraiths</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the taste of victory still sweet upon their tongues, the heroes find refuge on Coruscant with loyalists. Following the destruction of the Inquisitors’ tower, the Empire is searching for the culprits with extreme prejudice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just as there seems to be a lull in the action, word comes that one of the captive designers of the Sarlacc Project has survived, and is seeking asylum with the loyalists . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 1: DEPTHS OF THE CITY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coruscant is a planet of vast contrasts. The wealthiest of the galaxy’s citizens live in the sparkling spires that rise into the atmosphere like titanium needles, while the poorest eke out painful lives in polluted permacrete warrens. In between these two extremes is a dwindling middle class, which is often preyed upon by the denizens of both the heights and the depths of Coruscant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The safehouse that currently serves as a refuge for the heroes is within one of these tiny middle-class zones. It is a small domicile unit in a sprawling, enclosed apartment block. Security is minimal, consisting of door locks and a roving guard armed with a blaster pistol. The loyalists have made the best of what they have available, connecting three apartments with concealed doorways (successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them when closed). A map of the safehouse appears in the Safehouse of the Dead encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One apartment is used as a living area/barracks, and this is where the heroes are put up for the night. Its three bedrooms are small, each offering few amenities outside of cots with military-grade blankets. The second, center apartment is where the loyalists meet to discuss politics, plan actions, and learn skills that aren’t typically taught in school. The three bedrooms here have been converted into a workshop, a computer room (with a small Holonet transceiver), and an infirmary. The workshop is also an armory of sorts, stocked with a number of small arms and explosives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unlike the other two apartments, the last unit appears to be a sparsely furnished habitation with little or nothing out of place. It’s used for meetings with individuals who aren’t members of the loyalist cell, and for entertaining guests. A loyalist couple live there as husband and wife, working their day jobs and acting like good Imperial citizens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes interested in gaining access to the loyalists' small selection of supplies are allowed to do so, but the loyalists discourage them from taking too much. After all, they’ve spent months collecting this gear to further their agenda, and though they’ve seen only limited action so far, it is only a matter of time before they experience their baptism of fire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Presently, the armory contains the following items:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2 Blaster carbines</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4 Blaster pistols</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2 Hold-out blasters</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3 Light pistols</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1 Blaster rifle</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>28 Power cells</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6 Grenade, frag (Average)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3 Grenade, ion (Average)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3 Grenade, electrostun (Average)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1 Missile launcher</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1 Missile, ion (Deadly)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4 Thermal detonators</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3 Breaching charges</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3 Remote detonators</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to weapons, the loyalists possess some personal armor:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6 Composite armor sets</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2 Heavy exoskeleton sets</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The loyalist infirmary includes the following medical supplies:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4 Traumakits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10 Medpacs</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1 Battle adrenals</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The workshop has a number of tools and basic technical supplies for making ad hoc repairs and modifications to equipment while for mundane noncombat equipment, the loyalists have little to offer but can offer a few pieces of adventuring gear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the heroes have had time to get to know their hosts (and it seems like a good point in the game to get the action moving again), they are called into the computer room, where a message from Admiral Varth awaits them. The message is as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Excellent work. You’ve done quite a job exposing the Sarlacc Project, and you’ve exceeded my expectations. By now, the Inquisitorius is running around like a swarm of angry Dantari fire ants. You’ve made quite an impression on them, and I doubt they’ll underestimate you again. I know that I won’t.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“As much as we’d like to see you off-planet and out of danger, there is still a need for you to remain on Coruscant for a short while longer. Pavel Trenol, who had been forced to work as a designer for the Sarlacc Project, has contacted us seeking asylum. Prior to being pressed into duty by the Empire, Trenol was a weapons technician for Incom. In exchange for help, he’s promised to tell us everything he knows about the offensive capability of the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“It’s only a matter of time before the Empire realizes that Trenol’s body is not among the dead, and they’ll go looking for him. You should leave immediately and rendezvous with him. I’m providing a current holographic representation of Trenol with this transmission. He’s currently staying in a flophouse in one of Coruscant’s sublevels—an area known as the Gnawer’s Roost. It’s a bad part of town, so stay on your toes. On the plus side, Imperial security tends to avoid the place, as they’re none too popular in that region.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Good luck. I will await your signal when you return, and then we’ll see about getting you back to the Resurgence for some muchdeserved downtime.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A quick check reveals that the flophouse is nearby, in a region known colloquially as the Gnawer’s Roost. It's one of the nastiest neighborhoods in the area, a pit of depravity that is frequented by the worst that Coruscant’s underbelly has to offer: violent street gangs, spice dealers, smugglers, cutthroats, thieves, and other villains.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though the loyalists are willing to help the heroes, they aren’t seasoned enough to venture into the Gnawer’s Roost. The best they can do is offer the heroes support upon their return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can make their way into the lower levels of Coruscant by a number of methods. Taxis are the most common, though most taxi pilots charge a hazardous route fee if asked to descend into the Gnawer’s Roost. Unless you have other plans (see Auxiliary Challenge, below), the drive into the slums is uneventful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: It is possible to keep the heroes on their toes by mentioning the presence of law enforcement units in the area as they proceed to their destination. Alternatively, you can confront them with a security checkpoint manned by Imperial stormtroopers. Such checkpoints are common on Coruscant, and it takes a combination of careful navigation and street smarts to avoid having to pass through one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The majority of the taxi pilots who the heroes might hire are lawabiding citizens who are largely indifferent. Such pilots find it suspicious if the heroes request that they avoid Imperial checkpoints. If the pilot’s attitude remains indifferent, he attempts to avoid checkpoints, but this doubles his fee. If the heroes can improve the pilot’s attitude, he makes an effort to avoid checkpoints but won’t do anything overt to get himself into trouble. If the players have a helpful they do anything to help the heroes out, including running through a checkpoint.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Conversely, a pilot who has been annoyed stops his taxi and demands that the heroes get out. If the pilot becomes hostile, he heads for the nearest checkpoint and turns the heroes over to the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL CHECKPOING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter details an Imperial checkpoint on Coruscant. Given the heroes’ recent activities, only the most experienced stormtroopers are being put on guard at checkpoints. The troopers at this particular checkpoint are comprised of Coruscant Guards and several Death Troopers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Five of the six Coruscant Guard stand ready to take a shot at any non complaint citizens. The other Guard challenges drivers with a single Death Trooper being an imposing presence behind them while the other two Death Troopers observe from secure locations behind the permacrete barriers, as detailed on the encounter map.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The permacrete barriers are intended primarily to funnel speeders through the checkpoint in an orderly fashion, but also to provide cover to the stormtroopers. In addition, a shield generator has been installed here, preventing vehicles from moving through the checkpoint unless first deactivated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most likely, the heroes enter from the right edge of the map, either on foot or within a taxi or other vehicle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text as the heroes approach the checkpoint, either on foot or riding in a speeder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Up ahead you can make out an Imperial checkpoint. Several stormtroopers, weapons at the ready, stand guard, while an Imperial officer challenges vehicles as they pass through the checkpoint.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANT GUARD (6)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANT GUARD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (mesh armor, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 44 (8d8+8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>12 (+1) 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 11 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Wis +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +3, Insight +4, Intimidate +2, Perception +4, Piloting +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack.

While most of the equipment is not of note, the Death Trooper helmets are enhanced items that can be used by the players provided they were not damaged in the encounter. Selling these items should be extremely hard at any point due to where they come from, consider this if players decide to sell these helmets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DEATH TROOPER HELMET</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armour (helmet), advanced (requires attunement)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Death Troopers are an elite type of Stormtrooper designed for stealth, espionage and lethality. Assigned to Imperial Intelligence or other significantly ranked Imperial officers, their equipment is cutting edge as evidenced by this helmet's capabilites.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This helmet comes equipped with a headcomm and holorecorder. Additionally, while wearing this helmet, you have truesight out to 15 ft., blindsight out to 30 ft, and darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, this helmet grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight within 60 feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If not destroyed outright, the shield generator that blocks the road can be deactivated with a DC 17 Intelligence (Technology) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A number of other speeders stopped to the rear of the heroes contain loyal Imperial citizens who use personal communication devices to inform the authorities of the skirmish that has taken place if the troopers are unable to.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The permacrete barriers scattered throughout the area grant three quarters cover to any creature taking cover behind them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The energy barrier that has been installed here is similar to a low-strength deflector shield. It spans the road, as depicted on the encounter map, and it prevents speeders from driving through the checkpoint. The shield can be deactivated by the stormtroopers on duty. The shield is semitransparent and provides half cover to anyone standing behind it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE GNAWER'S ROOST</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Trenol's flophouse is deep in the heart of the Gnawer’s Roost, a dark, shadowy place permeated by foul smells and even fouler residents. Imperial law enforcement has no presence in Gnawer’s Roost, and the only rule is that might makes right. While in the area, the heroes might be approached by any number of seedy characters looking to make a deal or score a few credits. Parties who are obviously armed or combat capable are left alone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The flophouse is inside a grimy permacrete structure with a flickering holographic display out front that advertises hourly rates. Seven tough-looking youths, each sporting similar garb and colors, loiter outside the hotel, hungrily eying anyone who passes. Like the rest of the locale’s denizens, they do not accost anyone who appears to be wellarmed. Heroes who maintain a nonthreatening or benign countenance are verbally abused in the hopes that they will display some weakness. If combat breaks out, use the thug stat block from Traitor's Gambit for the street gangsters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door into the hotel enters directly into a lobby cluttered by all manner of garbage and junk. An abused 3PO droid, his corroded gray skin covered in graffiti and grime, resides behind a scarred and stained counter. Anyone peering behind the counter sees that the droid, designated 0T-3PO, is actually chained to the floor to prevent its theft, its escape, or both.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the flophouse, read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The interior of the flophouse’s lobby is no cleaner or promising than its exterior. Every surface seems filthy, from the torn chairs leaning up against the grimy walls to the thin metal counter covered in flimsy paper, old garbage, and empty food packets. Behind the counter stands a 3PO droid, his gray exterior patched with rust and corrosion. One of his eyes glows dully in the lobby’s dim light, while the other is dark and unseeing. “Ah, hello,” the droid pipes up in forced cordiality as you enter. “How may I be of assistance?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>0T-3PO has worked as the desk clerk in this flophouse for so long, he’s practically a fixture. In his time behind the counter, he’s seen a great many things, and his behavioral inhibitors have slowly eroded as a result. Though he rarely wishes for freedom— the outside world is a frightening place—he is somewhat annoyed by the fact that he is chained to the floor. “It’s not as if I would wander off. Doesn’t anyone trust me?” he often asks himself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The answer, of course, is “No.” 0T-3PO is incredibly untrustworthy and would sell out anyone for a few paltry credits. It isn’t precisely his fault; he can’t help himself. He is merely a product of his environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: The 3PO unit gladly tells the heroes where to find Pavel Trenol’s room—for a price. Much of the droid’s behavioral programming has been modified or removed, an unhappy result of existing in such a wicked part of Coruscant. The droid answers initial inquiries in an official tone, stating, “The requested information is confidential, as per the clause of our establishment’s rental agreement. However, for a small fee, payable in standard credits, the clause can be waived.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes can pay a bribe of 1,000 credits for the information, or they can attempt a DC 17 Wisdom (Persuasion) check to improve the droid’s attitude or intimidate him into revealing what they want to know. Heroes can also access the hotel’s computer to determine the location of Trenol’s room: unit 5212, five floors down. The fifth sublevel is accessible by a rickety turbolift or a perpetually moist and gloomy stairwell.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Room 5212’s door is constructed of thin alloy and covered in a peeling wood veneer. Using the chime or knocking at the door results in no answer. Heroes who succeed at a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear what sounds like a holovid unit playing. Forcing the door requires a key (available from 0T-3PO for an additional fee of 1,000 credits), a DC 18 Intelligence (security kit) check to bypass the lock, or a DC 20 Strength check to break down the door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inside is a poorly furnished hotel room about 15 feet square, with fraying carpet, peeling wallpaper, and an adjoining refresher that smells of mildew. A single holovid unit blares out the latest Podrace results in a combination of Huttese and Basic. The bed, sagging from age and long use, is empty. A quick search reveals that no one is present. A hero who makes a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a scrap of flimsy paper on top of the holovid unit, upon which is written “Invisible Hand.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: Obviously, the challenge here is for the heroes to find Trenol. The scrap of paper is a clue, but it will mean little to the heroes unless they can find someone who knows specifically what it refers to. Any hero who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check learns that the Invisible Hand was the name of General Grievous’s flagship during the Clone Wars, and that the vessel was destroyed during the Battle of Coruscant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes return to the hotel lobby, they can press the 3PO unit for information concerning Trenol’s whereabouts. The droid doesn’t know where Trenol is, only that he left hours ago in the company of several rough-looking Quarren. The droid attempts to milk this information for all the credits he can get, offering nothing unless specifically asked. If the heroes ask about the Invisible Hand, he responds: “I believe the Invisible Hand is a cantina. For a small fee, I can provide you with directions.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The droid is not the only individual with knowledge of the Invisible Hand’s location. The gangsters outside can be helpful with directions or information if they are properly motivated. Unlike the droid, however, the street gangsters don’t know Trenol and haven’t seen him or his Quarren companions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OGRE AMBUSH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the players travel from the flophouse to the Invisible Hand cantina, they are assaulted by a group of eight Coruscani ogres that are out scavenging for food. The ogres lie in wait for passing prey, emerging from the shadows in small groups and attacking en masse. Though they prefer their prey to be alive, they have no compunctions about dealing killing blows to foes that offer resistance. The screams of their victims are typically ignored by the neighborhood’s residents.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter takes place on an open stretch of street. The street is narrow, with many small nooks and alleys branching off of it. The heroes should start the encounter near the center of the encounter map. The eight Coruscani ogres begin as depicted on the map.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just prior to this encounter, allow the heroes to attempt DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) checks. Players that fail this check are surprised. When combat begins, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Walking through the damp and dim streets of the undercity, you are suddenly aware of a pungent odor: a mixture of rotten meat and animal musk. Grunts and growls emerge from the gloom around you, accompanied by several large, distorted shapes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Numerous creatures shamble into view, their features nightmare deformities. Hungry mouths ringed with rotten, jagged teeth slaver in anticipation of the meal to come. With a series of guttural sounds, the assembled beasts charge toward you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANI OGRES (8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coruscani ogres are large bipedal creatures that live within Coruscant’s deepest recesses. Twisted by their constant exposure to pollutants and toxic waste, no one can say what species the ogres originated from. No two Coruscani ogres are the same, but all share similar characteristics. Each is between 6 or 9 feet in height, with strong limbs of varying lengths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shaggy hair covers their hunched forms, though they possess various patches of oozing skin where no hair grows. Their broad mouths are filled with crooked fangs, and their loose skin hangs heavy with growths and tumors. Some possess horns, and all have jagged, filthy claws.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The beast before you appears to be an amalgam of many different life forms, but it’s hard to tell where one stops and the next starts. Gangly limbs are mixed with arms and legs that seem too short for the beast’s mass, yet it moves with remarkable speed despite the fact that it should not exist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CORUSCANI OGRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium beast, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 15 (mutated hide)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 85 (13d8+26)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>12 (+1) 9 (-1) 18 (+4) 4 (-3) 12 (+1) 7 (+-2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +4, Con +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Stealth +0, Perception +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Acid</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disturbing Visage.

Though they possess animal cunning, they are ruled by their instincts. In this particular instance, they are hungry, and they want to kill or incapacitate, then drag off, anyone or anything they can get their claws on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each ogre attacks as an individual. They don’t support or aid one another in any way. If more than five of the ogres are killed or subdued, the remaining ogres retreat into the shadows to lick their wounds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fight ends as suddenly as it started. Any heroes who can stomach getting close to the dead ogres can search the corpses, but they find little outside of stained and ragged cloth draped over the deformed shapes in a pitiful mockery of clothing but one ogre possesses what appears to be the head of a protocol droid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The street is cluttered with all manner of trash and debris. Moving through areas marked with debris on the map counts as moving through difficult terrain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: If the heroes wipe out the Coruscani ogres, they’ve inadvertently performed a good deed on behalf of the citizens of Gnawer’s Roost. Witnesses to the scuffle spread word of the heroes’ deeds, furthering their reputations and, in many cases, their personal standing within the community. Though this won’t result in any monetary compensation, it goes a long way toward ingratiating the heroes with the locals. Residents of Gnawer’s Roost who know of the heroes’ role in the ogre pack’s destruction are automatically friendly with the players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though Gnawer’s Roost is a haven of inequity, the citizens still feel a certain amount of gratitude toward people who have helped them in some way. Nearly every resident of the neighborhood knows of someone who was purportedly killed by a Coruscani ogre, and it is assumed that anyone who vanishes in Gnawer’s Roost has been abducted and subsequently eaten by the creatures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE INVISIBLE HAND CANTINA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Named after the flagship of the late General Grievous, the Invisible Hand is a seedy cantina that caters to ex-Separatists and political dissidents. Though not overtly political, the clientele consists of bitter and disenfranchised individuals who were on the losing side of the Clone Wars (or who want others to think that they were). In Gnawer’s Roost, the cantina has a mixed reputation. On one hand, the regulars are mostly seen as losers who are attempting to relive their bygone days of glory. Conversely, many of the downtrodden residents of the surrounding slums view ex-Separatists as anti-establishment heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From the outside, the Invisible Hand appears to be little more than a run-down tenement. The only indication that the cantina exists is a hexagonal sign in flickering blue neon, reminiscent of the Confederacy’s emblem. A set of steep stairs, slippery with moldy dampness, leads down to the cantina’s entrance. A single Quarren bouncer named Tekkur stands guard at the door. He keeps an eye out for trouble, but he won’t do anything to dissuade the heroes from entering the cantina.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The interior of the Invisible Hand is dim and clouded by a mixture of smoke and bitter Quarren incense. The air is thick and pungent, laced with a multitude of aromas—not all of them legal. The walls are hung with flags, old Separatist recruitment posters, and war memorabilia. Pieces of alloy, which knowledgeable characters can identify as parts of a ship’s hull, are hung here and there with reverence. These are purportedly fragments of the original Invisible Hand that fell to the ground when the ship crashed during the Battle of Coruscant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The cantina is sparsely populated. Aside from the bouncer at the door, there is a Gran bartender, Klef, serving two Trandoshan laborers at the bar, and a group of four Quarren toughs in the company of a single Human male near the rear of the establishment. The heroes likely assume that the Human is Pavel Trenol, and they are partly correct. The man appears to be the same one detailed in the hologram that Admiral Varth sent with his transmission, but his real name isn’t Pavel Trenol; it’s Tavik Moern.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tavik Moern is a deep cover operative with the Imperial Security Bureau. His normal duties include monitoring dissident groups in parts of the planet that are best avoided by uniformed agents. He is currently assigned to ensure that the heroes don’t leave Gnawer’s Roost alive. To this end, he has brought along several other agents to aid him who are currently disguised as Quarrens through holograms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tavik Moern feigns innocence at first. Heroes who examine him or the Quarren in an attempt to sense deception must succeed at a DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover the deception.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: The obvious challenge here is for the heroes to defeat their enemies and survive. Capturing Tavik Moern and exposing his true nature should bring the heroes to the conclusion that something is terribly wrong. Apparently, Varth’s information was faulty. This might cause the heroes to wonder if Varth himself (or someone else in their organization) is untrustworthy. If questioned directly about Admiral Varth, Moern spits and calls him a traitor to the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes enter the cantina through the door at the south end of the encounter map. Tables and chairs are scattered around the interior of the tavern as depicted on the map. Tavik Moern and his Quarren goons are at the northern end of the room, standing between the heroes and the rear exit of the cantina.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Klef, the Gran bartender, resides behind the bar on the west side of the room. Two Trandoshan workers sit at the bar, drinking. Tekkur, the Quarren bouncer, is just outside the front door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the players enter the cantina, read the following text aloud. Any heroes who succeed at a DC 24 Perception check notice that something is suspiciously wrong with the Human, as if he is pretending to be something (or someone) that he isn’t.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just past the burly Quarren sentry at the bottom of the stairs leading into the cantina, you can make out a large, smoky room cluttered with tables and chairs. The bar, which is fashioned with sheets of chromed metal, is hosted by a weary-looking Gran in stained overalls. Two Trandoshans sit at the near end of the bar chatting amicably as their frothing drinks gather condensation in front of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Past the bar, in the dimmest part of the cantina, you see five humanoids seated around a table that is covered with empty mugs. Four of the shapes—Quarren, by the look of them—stand as you enter, their black eyes intent upon you. The fifth shape—a familiar looking Human—remains seated, his hands placed very carefully on the tabletop in front of him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the Quarren barks a command, and the four spread out as their holograms drop, exposing their human forms as they reach for their weapons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TAVIK MOERN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tavik Moern is a young and idealistic Human operative who works for the Imperial Security Bureau. He is of medium height, mildly handsome yet unimposing in appearance, with medium-length brown hair, brown eyes, and three days’ worth of beard growth on his cheeks and chin. He dresses in the manner of a technical laborer—stained overalls, a tool belt, and heavy workman’s boots.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Moern used to work for the Republic, ferreting out traitors and dissidents during the Clone Wars. He has an excellent record and is highly regarded by his superiors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Human looks to be the same one depicted in the hologram that Admiral Varth sent you. His brown hair is medium length, and his brown eyes regard you with apprehension. He wears a set of greasestained coveralls, a tool belt, and a pair of scuffed workman’s boots.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TAVIK MOERN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (combat suit, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 44 (8d10)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8 (-1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 15 (+2) 12 (+1) 14 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Int +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Perception +3, Stealth +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 3 (700 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

Persuasive heroes might ultimately find ways to pin Moern’s ears back, but aside from his assignment—to pose as Pavel Trenol and kill the heroes—he has very little useful information. What he does know, however, is that his task was part of a larger plan to wipe out a loyalist cell on Coruscant while also dealing with the players. “It doesn’t matter what you do to me,” he sneers if caught. “It’s already too late for your seditionist friends.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ISB UNDERCOVER AGENT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (combat suit, light shield generator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 113 (25d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8 (-1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 15 (+2) 12 (+1) 14 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Int +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Perception +3, Stealth +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

About the only thing he can reveal, outside of his affiliation with the ISB, is that this attack was merely part of a larger plan to wipe out a loyalist cell on Coruscant while also dealing with the players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: BAIT AND CHASE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite the trouble the heroes have caused in the Invisible Hand, no authorities are forthcoming in the depths of the Gnawer’s Roost. The fighting is by no means unusual. As long as none of the locals, such as Klef or Tekkur, have been undeservedly harmed in the fighting, the residents won’t bat an eye at the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the heroes will find that any calls they make to the loyalist safehouse following the fight go unanswered. This should raise alarms in their heads, especially if they are in need of information or medical attention. Though they might find some use in remaining in Gnawer’s Roost for a while (whether it’s to ask questions or do some other investigations), their real concern should be to ensure that their loyalist friends at the safehouse are all right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SAFEHOUSE OF THE DEAD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The return to the safehouse is remarkably uneventful. Another taxi (or even the same one, depending on how the trip into the Gnawer’s Roost ended) can be hired to transport the heroes, or they can make other arrangements. Strangely enough, Imperial checkpoints are positioned so as to keep citizens from entering the more dangerous portions of the city, especially since criminals and other miscreants can descend into the bowels of Coruscant and lose themselves there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The quiet is perhaps the most disconcerting thing about the trip. The heroes’ ears are still ringing from their last shootout, and nothing feels quite right. Every set of eyes that glances their way is suspect; every siren or alarm might be a result of their passing. Even more than before, there should be a sense of tension and paranoia in the air.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From outside, the tenement block that contains the safehouse apartments looks the same as when the heroes left for the Gnawer’s Roost. Force-sensitive heroes have a distinct feeling that they are being watched, even though nothing is visible. Entering the building is just as uneventful, whether the heroes take a turbolift or climb one of the two narrow stairwells that lead up to the safehouse floor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once they arrive on the tenement’s third floor, they know that something is definitely wrong. The ozone-sweet smell of blaster fire lingers in the air, along with a thin, smoky haze. The walls of the hallway are scorched and burned in some areas, and a dark substance—fresh blood—stains the carpet. Entering the safehouse through any one of the three doors (all of which are open), the heroes are greeted with the macabre sight of their loyalist hosts, dead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some of the loyalists obviously went down fighting, blasters held tightly in their stiffening fingers. It looks like a number of others were rounded up after the fact, put against a wall, and executed in a flurry of blaster fire. Despite their best efforts, the heroes find no survivors— everyone they met during their stay in the safehouse is dead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes probably seek to raid the safehouse’s supplies, which have not been taken or tampered with. But they won’t have much time to rummage around. Once they discover the dead and search the entirety of the safehouse for survivors, allow them to attempt DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) checks. Success indicates that they hear the sounds of stealthy movement out in the hallway.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The tactical team that was sent to wipe out the loyalist contingent has been waiting in an upstairs apartment for signs that they missed someone. They have been monitoring life signals and motion using a bank of portable scanners, which have revealed the heroes’ arrival and movements.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes appear to be occupied with supplying themselves, or when they seem to be leaving the premises, the tactical team moves into position and attempts to wipe them out. They attack from opposite sides of the building and take no prisoners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the event that the heroes venture upstairs to search for enemies, the tactical team sets an ambush, waiting for them to clear the turbolift or stairs before opening fire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes begin inside the safehouse apartments and should be positioned where they were when their Wisdom (Perception) checks were made. The tactical team starts in the hall on either side of the apartment doors, as depicted on the encounter map.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes who make a successful DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check hear the agents’ movement in the corridor.

If any members of the squad survive, they take up defensive positions across the street from the apartment block and call for backup. If the heroes leave via the apartment’s front entrance, these survivors attempt to pin them down with heavy blaster fire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If reinforcements arrive, they consist of a two squads of stormtroopers and a Stormtrooper Captain. Half an hour later, more reinforcements arrive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Considering that the heat is definitely on, the heroes should strongly consider evacuating the planet. They have no visible means of support on Coruscant at the moment, and the entire Imperial machine is about to come down on their heads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHERE GIANTS TREAD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Make it clear that the heroes are wanted more than ever before. Coruscant is no longer safe, and their faces, if not their names, are known to the authorities. The seat of the Empire is the last place they want to be. The heroes might be tempted to flee to the undercity (especially if they have cultivated allies there due to their actions in the Gnawer’s Roost), but that merely forestalls the inevitable Imperial advance into that part of the city.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of course, getting off Coruscant won’t be a walk in the park. The planet crawls with Imperial troops, and every one of them is looking for the heroes. They should expect a difficult time of things, and tensions ought to be high, but the trip to the starport where their ship is located is easier than expected—suspiciously so, in fact.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When they arrive at the starport, they find it a ghost town until they see the Imperials waiting for them, a prototype AT-AT. This prototype has been sent to stop the heroes from leaving Coruscant. The overwhelming force is meant to discourage the heroes from trying to leave in their own ship. The Empire doesn’t give them credit for being foolish enough to face the challenge head-on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes show their faces brazenly, the AT-AT immediately fires at them. Though the AT-AT crew has been instructed take out the heroes, they haven’t been authorized to destroy the terminal building. However, if the heroes become a nuisance or prove capable of posing a threat to the AT-AT, these orders will be ignored.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The tarmac of the landing field is divided into a number of docking bays, each one holding a different starship. The heroes’ vessel is near the end of the tarmac, and an AT-AT has been positioned nearby with a wonderful view of the area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes begin on the far end of the tarmac, directly opposite the AT-AT.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text aloud when the heroes arrive at the landing field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You take in the landing field with a quick, sweeping glance. The gray permacrete surface is embellished by countless lights and endless lines painted in reflective enamel. Several ships and space transports are parked upon slightly raised landing platforms, with your vessel at the far end of the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Curiously, you don’t see any of the usual activity one would expect on a busy spaceport tarmac: no labor droids moving cargo to and fro, and no customs officials inspecting the assembled ships. Then you realize that the landing field is well guarded, with a massive Imperial AT-AT standing almost directly above your transport like a huge, armored watchdog. Its head moves slowly back and forth as it searches for prey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PROTOTYPE AT-AT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The AT-AT is present to provide armored support and to ensure that the heroes are easily neutralized. The Empire doesn’t believe that anyone would be foolish enough to confront an AT-AT. On the off chance of an attack, the crew’s orders are to prevent the heroes’ ship from taking off. If the heroes are able to man their vessel, the AT-AT is to focus fire on it and destroy it. If the ship somehow manages to take to the sky, the AT-AT crew is expected to shoot it down.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite the usual transport nature of the AT-AT, this one has no troops to deploy and thus cannot use the Deploy Troops legendary action. If statistics for the crew of the AT-AT are needed, use the Scout Trooper stat block.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the Imperials, they can board their ship and take off. This is met by radio chatter from the landing field’s control tower along the lines of, “Stand down! You do not have authorization to depart!” The heroes likely ignore this radio contact. Meanwhile, the tower personnel contacts the local authorities to inform them of the breach. This causes a number of TIE fighters to scramble, but unless the heroes stick around an inordinately long time, they should be able to make orbit and go to hyperspace in short order.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes did not destroy the AT-AT, the Imperials take a few shots at the heroes’ ship as it starts its engines and takes off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PROTOTYPE AT-AT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gargantuan construct, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 20 (armor plating)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 330 (20d20+120)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>27 (+8) 14 (+2) 23 (+6) 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 9 (-1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +14, Con +12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities ion</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances damage from unenhanced weapons, necrotic, poison, psychic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities disease, exhaustion, poisoned, unconscious</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 19 (22,000 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Attenuated Leg Design The AT-AT's legs are extremely thin. Attacks with a lightweapon that target the construct's legs and hit ignore the construct's resistances and the Heavy Durasteel Armor trait.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Circuitry. The construct has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heavy Durasteel Armor. The outer layer of the AT-AT is covered in heavy armor, making it difficult for smaller arms to damage it. The AT-AT takes no damage from an attack or effect that deals less than 25 points.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Operated. The construct is operated by both a pilot and gunner and roll initiative separately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gunner. The construct requires an active gunner to take any actions controlled by the gunner, and if the gunner is subjected to any conditions that the construct is not immune to, the construct is also subjected to those conditions. The gunner may take their own action or one of the actions granted by the construct.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Piloted. The construct requires an active pilot to take any actions controlled by the pilot, and if the pilot is subjected to any conditions that the construct is not immune to, the construct is also subjected to those conditions.

If the construct is knocked over and falls prone, it can’t right itself and is incapacitated until upright again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Siege Weaponry. The AT-AT attacks are considered enhanced. Additionally the AT-AT deals double damage to objects or structures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Towering. Creatures of Large size or smaller can stand in the AT-AT's space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Troop Transport. The construct can can transport a maximum of 40 stormtroopers and five speeder bikes, which it can deploy using its Deploy Troops legendary action, or which can be fought by creatures inside of the AT-AT.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vulnerable Interior The construct's interior is vulnerable to damage done by grenades, mines and charges, unless it is immune to that damage. It also automatically fails all Dexterity saving throws from such effects that occur in its interior.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pilot. The pilot of the construct can use Frightful Presence and use Stomp.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Frightful Presence. Each creature of the AT-AT's choice within 240 feet of the AT-AT and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the AT-AT's Frightful Presence for 24 hours.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stomp. All creatures within 10 feet of the AT-AT must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gunner. The gunner of the construct can use the Heavy Laser Cannon Barrage and attack once with the Cheek Mounted Medium Laser Cannons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cheek Mounted Medium Laser Cannons. Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 240/320 ft., one target. Hit 13 (2d10+2) energy damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heavy Laser Cannon Barrage. The AT-AT chooses a point within 320 ft and lets loose a blast from each of its heavy laser cannons that explodes in a 15ft cube around that point. Each creature within the cube must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEGENDARY ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The AT-AT can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one deployed creature can use a legendary action, only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The AT-AT regains spent legendary actions at the start of the pilot's turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cheek Mounted Medium Laser Cannons. The AT-AT makes a single attack with its Cheek Mounted Medium Laser Cannons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Stomp. (Costs 2 Actions) The AT-AT uses the Stomp action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Deploy Troops (Costs 2 Actions). The AT-AT mobilizes some of the soldiers traveling within it. It deploys 1d4+2 Troopers and 1 74-Z speeder bike. These troops appear in any unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the AT-AT.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: The goal of this encounter is escape. The heroes must neutralize or bypass the enemies in the starport so they can enter their ship and leave for safer pastures. One option is to run headlong into the fray, relying on their own skill to keep them alive against overwhelming odds. They also might consider going in quietly, attempting to sneak to their ship without being seen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both options have merit, but the quiet route is liable to be difficult considering that the tarmac is a wide open, empty space with only a few starships to provide cover. If the heroes took the missile launcher with its enhanced missile from the safehouse, they might try to take the AT-AT out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: Even if the heroes manage to escape, they might be suspicious because the Empire had access to their ship for an undetermined amount of time. They are quite right to be concerned—the Empire’s technicians have been busy in a number of nefarious ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first problem is a large detonite charge attached to the reactor of their starship. The charge is hidden well by Imperial standards; it requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate and a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) to disarm. The bomb is linked to the ship’s hyperdrive and detonates only if the heroes engage light speed. The resulting explosion will destroy the ship, kill the heroes, and prematurely end the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes roll poorly or don’t think to look for evidence of foul play, give them a few ominous hints, such as “Who knows how long the Empire had access to your ship?” or “A number of access panels around the ship seem to be out of place.” You can also mention that there seem to be a large number of odd fluctuations as the heroes enter the hyperspace coordinates into the navigation computer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The bomb should not be a death sentence for unlucky heroes. It’s designed to show that they are considered a huge threat by their enemies; they ought to be flattered.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the detonite charge, the Imperials placed three tracking devices throughout the ship. In case the heroes manage to recover their ship, disarm the bomb, and escape from Coruscant, the Empire wants to be able to track them down and finish the job. Two tracking devices are in relatively obvious locations, with little effort made to conceal them; they require DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) checks to find. The third tracking device is hidden more carefully, deep within the recesses of the life support system; it requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Note: Escaping aboard the player's ship while discovering and disarming the Imperial devices should be considered a level up milestone.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: RESURGENCE OF EVIL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes escape from Coruscant, they should have a short time to relax while hurtling through hyperspace. Their destination should be the Resurgence, either by direct flight or via one or two false destinations in an attempt to shake any pursuit. This is a good time to heal wounds, take stock of resources, and search the ship for additional forms of sabotage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes emerge from hyperspace at the rendezvous point, they are greeted by the sight of a large battle between loyalist forces, including the Resurgence, and two Imperial Star Destroyers. A Corellian Gunship and one of two Corellian Corvettes have been destroyed, and pieces of those ships can be seen tumbling through space. A second Corvette is currently the primary target of the Imperial capital ships, and it is not doing particularly well in the rather one-sided exchange.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hyperspace gives way to a dramatic scene: a number of ships on the horizon, including the Resurgence, are trading turbolaser fire. Orange explosions can be seen in the space surrounding the capital ships, signs of starfighter combat that is too far away to make out clearly. Two Star Destroyers on the edge of their effective range send out countless turbolaser blasts. The blasts are aimed primarily at the remaining Corellian Corvette but also at the Resurgence and the other ships under her protection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the Resurgence stands her ground, directing her own turbolaser blasts back at the Imperial ships, the other ships in the loyalist flotilla move away in an attempt to escape the melee. A flash of light followed by a large ball of fire and debris marks the violent end of a Gallofree transport.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Your communications crackle to life suddenly, and the voice of Captain Verana greets you:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“You’re too late,” he says. “They’ve got us right where they want us. It’d be suicide for you to stay, but we’re running out of options. All of our escape pods have been jettisoned, and our shields are about to buckle. Mind if we hitch a ride with you?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The voice of a nervous crewman in the background cuts in. “Sir! We’ve got reports of Imperial troops on board!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Verana curses. “On second thought, you guys might be better off—”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An intense hiss of static ends the transmission.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At this juncture, the heroes can easily turn tail and run. The Imperial ships haven’t noticed them, and they’ve been ordered to retreat. Of course, running away wouldn’t be the heroic thing to do, especially in a Star Wars game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TO THE RESCUE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gaining access to the Resurgence is easier than it sounds, all things considered. The majority of the heavy fire is being concentrated on the last of the Corellian Corvettes, and the majority of the enemy TIE fighters are tangling with the loyalist starfighters. Docking can be accomplished only via a docking tunnel, similar to the one that the Millennium Falcon used to dock with the Redemption at the end of The Empire Strikes Back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The docking tunnel leads to the capital ship’s interior. Chaos is everywhere as lights flash and klaxons blare. Bodies of the crew litter the corridors, punctuated by the corpse of an occasional stormtrooper. Some corridors are impassable, requiring the heroes to double back and look for other means of access. A list of possible hazards faced by the heroes includes:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A climb up (or down) a malfunctioning turbolift to gain access to an upper (or lower) level</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Passing through a corridor that is swinging with live power cables</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Moving through a sealed compartment that has recently been exposed to open space, or within which life support systems have failed</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Occasional turbulence caused by incoming turbolaser fire from the Star Destroyers</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Areas that have no power and are completely dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition, the ship occasionally rocks as another wave of turbolaser fire hits the hull.

Though the heroes encounter no Imperial troops, the occasional dead or mortally wounded stormtrooper is proof that troops are somewhere nearby. When they finally make their way to the corridors surrounding the Resurgence’s command deck, they are greeted by a stormtrooper squad that is preparing to storm the cockpit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In this encounter, the heroes attempt to access the bridge of the Resurgence, where the crew is under fire by a squad of elite stormtroopers and their officer. The bridge crew has been whittled down to Captain Verana and five men. Bodies of dead and dying crewmen litter the bridge. Likewise, several stormtroopers lie motionless in the access corridor, smoking holes in their white armor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Position the elite stormtroopers, their captain, Captain Verana, and the remaining crew of the Resurgence on the bridge.

Peering around a corner, you see the bridge access corridor crowded with the bodies of fallen crew and stormtroopers. From the looks of things, the crew attempted to evacuate but instead were bottled up here by a squad of stormtroopers led by a captain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“All right, Verana,” the captain calls over a sustained burst of fire. “This is your last chance!

The Resurgence is crawling with Imperial troops, his crew is being massacred, Gilder Varth has vanished, and the Jedi master, Denia, has been taken prisoner by none other than Inquisitor Valin Draco. To make matters worse, Verana has been wounded by a stray blaster shot. He can tell that it’s a superficial wound, but the sight of him bleeding has spooked what few crew he has left.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Huddled behind a terminal, you see Captain Verana.

Heroes with medical experience can provide first aid, but Verana waves off any more, saying, “We haven’t time for that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following aloud once the pleasantries are out of the way:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I’ve got some bad news,” Verana says. “We’ve had a report that Master Denia has been taken prisoner by the Inquisitorius.” The Captain lets the news sink in for a moment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“If you think you can make it, get to the landing bay at once. You might be able to stop the Inquisitors before they can get her off the Resurgence. My crew and I can find our way to your ship, and we’ll meet you there. Now go!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s important that the heroes stick together at this point and trust that Verana and his crew can make it on their own. The heroes will need everyone for the upcoming encounters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A LINE OF PRISONERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Somewhere between the ship’s bridge and its landing bay, the heroes encounter a line of prisoners being led to the docking bay by a mixed group of Inquisitors and purge troopers. There are a total of 10 prisoners, and all of them appear to be run-of-the-mill crew and passengers. Although they aren’t bound, the prisoners are keenly aware of the weapons pointed at them by their captors. Their future looks bleaker by the moment—the only thing they have to look forward to is an interrogation followed by imprisonment or death</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter takes place in one of the many corridors that span the length of the Resurgence. A line of 10 prisoners, each with his hands atop his head, is being escorted down the corridor, two by two. They are led by three members of the Inquisitorius, as well as a small detachment of purge troopers. The prisoners, Inquisitors, and purge troopers are positioned as indicated on the map.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes should be able to get the drop on the Imperial forces, and they can position themselves in any of the adjoining corridors, as well as at either end, prior to the start of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes are in position, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Resurgence rocks as another blast of turbolaser fire hits it, and the lights in the corridor flicker briefly. The sound of raised voices can be heard. A quick glance reveals a column of prisoners escorted by a number of stormtroopers, as well as three Humans in the unmistakable garb of Inquisitors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Hurry up, slugs! Get moving, or I’ll have the lot of you shot!” one of the Inquisitors growls at the prisoners. As if to punctuate his order, he raises his lightsaber and brings it to the neck of a nearby prisoner. The look in the Inquisitor’s eye tells you that he’s about to murder the prisoner down in cold blood.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITORS (3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The three Inquisitors here are typically assigned to ferret out Jedi and other illicit practitioners of the Force. Due to the chaos on Coruscant, they’ve been pulled to assist Valin Draco in the attack on the Resurgence. They’re none too happy about the change in duties, and they’re more than willing to take their ire out on one or two prisoners who won’t be missed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR KNIGHT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid, lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 15 (fiber armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 81 (18d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11 (+0) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 13 (+1) 12 (+1) 18 (+4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Wis +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Perception +5, Stealth +5, Survival +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Binary</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (700 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting.

The majority of them head toward the heroes’ ship, if given leave to do so. One or two prisoners volunteer to accompany the heroes to the landing bay and help in any way they can.

It is filled with debris and a large number of fallen crew members. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two Imperial shuttles sit upon the floor of the landing bay, the black expanse of space visible through the shielded opening behind them. Multicolored flashes of light flicker across the starfield, signs of the space battle that continues to rage outside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A number of individuals, many of them dressed in the black uniforms of the Inquisitorius, scurry about as prisoners are escorted at gunpoint aboard the first shuttle. You notice a familiar figure—Master Denia—among the prisoners. She spares a fleeting glance over her shoulder in your direction before disappearing into the shuttle’s interior with the rest of the captives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before you can react, a second figure, also familiar, turns to face you. Inquisitor Valin Draco, his features marred by a black metallic faceplate with a single red optic, meets your gaze. He makes a dismissive gesture, then hurriedly boards the shuttle as the boarding ramp begins to close.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s too late to save Master Denia and face down the new and improved Draco, but a second Imperial shuttle remains as the first rises into the air and turns to exit the docking bay of the Resurgence. An Inquisitor and two purge troopers have taken up positions near the second shuttle, and they are aware of the heroes’ presence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Position the Imperials on the encounter map. The heroes can set up anywhere within 10 feet of the blast doors leading into the docking bay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MISHA VEKKIAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Misha Vekkian was once a Jedi Padawan before she was discovered by the Inquisitorius and turned to the dark side. Since then, she has become a cruel mistress, and the troops that serve under her succeed or die by her hand. She is merciless, spiteful, and vindictive, never forgetting a perceived slight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In truth, she blames the Jedi for what she has become. She was brought into the Jedi Order by no desire of her own; had she been left alone, her Force talents might never have been discovered.

Their home is being systematically destroyed by Imperial turbolaser fire. The last Corellian Corvette, by some miracle of fate or luck, is limping away from the fray with a number of TIE fighters in hot pursuit. Captain Verana is beside himself but does his best to comfort his crew despite his own grief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The rest of the Resurgence’s surviving fleet is gone, having entered hyperspace while the heroes were aboard their flagship. The only thing that remains is for the heroes to escape. As they move into position to make a jump into hyperspace, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is a crackle of static as you are hailed by one of the Imperial Star Destroyers. The video image flickers and stabilizes, revealing the image of Admiral Varth dressed in an immaculate Imperial Navy uniform.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“It seems as if I didn’t give you enough credit for being resourceful,” Varth says, his eyes betraying a hint of respect. “But now the time for deception has ended. Despite your persistence, as well as your luck, you must admit that you are outmatched. Shut down your engines and prepare to be boarded.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Varth is full of bluster and threat, but the truth is that he can do nothing to stop the heroes from making their escape. If engaged in conversation, Varth reveals little of his involvement in the plot other than saying, “Had you not proven so talented, none of this would have been necessary.” If questioned about his apparent defection, he can’t suppress a smirk as he casually mentions how easy it was to fool the heroes and the others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Varth entertains conversation only as long as it remains civil or worthwhile. He signs off by saying, “I’m sure we will meet again.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some time passes between the heroes making the jump into hyperspace and their rendezvous with what remains of the Rebel fleet. Ultimately, they must report to Bail Organa concerning all that has occurred in the past few days. Organa meets with the heroes personally, congratulating each of them on a job well done despite the odds that were against them and the price that was paid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When everyone is present, Organa makes the following short speech:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“We’ve paid a heavy price for the information you’ve managed to gather. We've also learned, unfortunately, that we have been tricked—betrayed. Some of you might be asking yourselves: Is it worth the cost?\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I can’t answer that question. Not yet, in any case. What I do know is that I am still determined to see Palpatine’s regime toppled, and any knowledge we have of his plots and plans will ultimately be of some use to us.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“As to those friends and allies we’ve lost, they will not be forgotten. Denia will be found, I promise, and when she is . . . when she is, you’ll be there to bring her back from the brink. Until then, we will all of us stay the course.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WWW.GMBINDER.COM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This document was lovingly created using GM Binder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you would like to support the GM Binder developers, consider joining our Patreon community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GM Binder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Discover</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Log In</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Register</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Further Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terms of Service</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Us</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"ga3psiio1CYjrWXA","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Due to interference caused by chemicals in many of the local fungi, it takes nearly <strong>1 minute</strong> to establish communications with the nearest Imperial facility. Thus, the <strong>scout troopers</strong> try to distract the heroes for <strong>10 rounds</strong>, hoping to buy time for one of the soldiers to call for reinforcements. If the heroes fail to defeat the Imperials in this time period, the call goes out, and six more <strong>scout troopers</strong> on speeder bikes arrive <strong>2 minutes</strong> later.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the soldiers and seize control of the communications facility, they have an opportunity to wreak some havoc with Imperial communications. A successful <strong>DC 15 Technology check </strong>tunes the communications array to the same frequency as the interference generated by the Felucian plant life, essentially broadcasting white noise across the entire Imperial communications spectrum. Doing so also scrambles the navigational arrays built into<strong> scout trooper armor</strong>, which prevents reinforcements from arriving.</p>\n<h4>Features of the Area</h4>\n<p>The stream that runs through the middle of this area counts as <strong>difficult terrain</strong>, and any characters lying <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.r2bQT0RrvwFIWKGh]{Prone}</strong> in the water must hold their breath or begin to drown.

{"_id":"3sLdbxlHFjhcIsiJ","name":"Discovering Denia","content":"<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Discovering Denia</h2>\n<p>One of the most critical events that happens during the heroes’ stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> is their discovery of a comatose Jedi Master named <strong>Denia</strong>. This event should occur only near the end of their stay in the <strong>palace</strong>, and most likely after the heroes have gone through the five events in <strong>Darga’s court </strong>(and perhaps obtained the <em>datacard</em> granting access to the guest quarters). Since the discovery of <strong>Denia </strong>will probably conclude the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, do not rush in introducing this event.</p>\n<p>During the Clone Wars, <strong>Denia </strong>was fighting on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong> when she was injured in an explosion. One of the Separatist generals had her unconscious form brought to this <strong>palace </strong>and placed in an artificial coma while they decided what to do with her. When the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end, the Separatists fled the <strong>palace </strong>and left the Jedi behind. <strong>Darga</strong> moved in soon after and discovered <strong>Denia’s </strong>comatose body. Never one to throw away a potential resource, <strong>Darga</strong> had her moved to the lowest levels of the <strong>palace </strong>and kept unconscious, thinking that there might come a day when she could prove useful. When the heroes arrived, <strong>Denia </strong>could sense their presence even while unconscious (either because one or more of the heroes is <strong>Force </strong>sensitive, or because destiny swirls about them), and she reaches out to them for help.</p>\n<p>This first becomes apparent when the heroes (particularly any <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes) start hearing whispers in their heads. If the heroes stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> after their time in his court, one or two of them begin to hear whispers in their sleep, so strongly that they awaken. If the heroes appear to be making plans to leave, you can have them hear the whispers while awake. The voice, clearly that of a woman, says things such as, <em><strong>“Help</strong> <strong>me,”</strong></em> and “<em><strong>I know you can hear me.”</strong></em> If the heroes attempt to ignore the whispers, the voice becomes more insistent, begging for help and pleading with them to find her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes search for a way to find the whispers, they discover that the voice becomes stronger if they descend through the guest quarters into the lower reaches of the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor and were given the <em>datacard</em> to access the secret way in and out of the guest quarters, they can also use it to access a turbolift to the lower levels of the guest quarters. The turbolift leads them directly to the chambers where <strong>Denia </strong>is being held.</p>\n<p>If the heroes never obtained the <em>datacard,</em> they can still reach <strong>Denia </strong>by finding a stairwell that leads down into the lower guest quarters. However, this path passes through an antechamber where some of <strong>Darga’s Gamorrean guards</strong> await. The guards tell the heroes to turn back, and if they refuse, a fight ensues.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Into the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[PyhIV17Hc6Zo8A34]{2-06 Into the Dungeons}</p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>is being held in a dank, disgusting area directly beneath the guest quarters that resembles a dungeon. The chamber is in disrepair, and structural damage to the <strong>palace </strong>has allowed rainwater to leak in, giving the place a musty feel. If the heroes step out of the turbolift, they see a narrow hallway filled with pools of stagnant water, with cells off to the right. The whispers grow louder in their minds, urging them on and giving them directions to a large metal door.</p>\n<p>Pushing a button on the door causes it to creak and stutter as it slides open, revealing a chamber that resembles a dilapidated hospital room. It has the same musty smell as the outer hallway, but in this room is a large bed on which lays a woman well into her older years, connected to a variety of machines that seem to be monitoring her vital functions. A large tube of semitransparent liquid is connected to the woman intravenously, and her chest rises and falls slowly. Once inside the room, the whispers in the <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes’ minds become stronger, and the voice claims that she can feel them close to her. <strong>Denia </strong>telepathically begs the heroes to free her, though the limitations on her telepathy keep her from asking or answering any more questions</p>\n<p>Any hero can disconnect <strong>Denia </strong>from the machines that are keeping her in a coma. A hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check</strong> can bring her out of the coma gently, and she regains consciousness with <strong>4 levels of exhaustion</strong>. Otherwise, she regains consciousness with 5 levels of exhaustion and cannot move. This exhaustion cannot be removed until she receives extended medical treatment for at least a week (which she will be able to get aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> between adventures).</p>\n<p>When <strong>Denia </strong>has been brought out of her coma, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The eyes of the older woman on the bed flicker open and then seem glazed for a long moment before drawing into sharp focus.

She tells the heroes that she is a Jedi Master and that she was assigned to <strong>Plo Koon’s</strong> battle group here on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. She was engaged in a pitched battle against the Separatists when a droid starfighter crashed near her, sending her into blackness. When her mind had recovered from the damage done to her body, she found herself unable to awaken or to purge her system of the drugs that were keeping her in a coma. She has been trying to reach out for help, but the only visitor to her room has been someone who seems shrouded in darkness. She doesn’t know who this person is (in truth, it is <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, the majordomo) or why he or she enters the room, but she did not attempt to make contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>asks the heroes to help her escape, since she has clearly been held prisoner for a while. She has many questions for them and wants to learn what has happened since she was knocked unconscious. If the heroes tell her honestly what has transpired since the conclusion of the Clone Wars, she senses the truth of their words and seems disheartened, but she vows to press on and escape from the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes attempt to deceive her, <strong>Denia </strong>tries to sense their true motives (her Perception score is high, even when penalized, and she has a good chance to see through their ruses), but she plays along for the time being. She is eager to leave and has no desire to stay in these dungeons any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>The heroes probably have some questions for <strong>Denia</strong>. Below are some answers to common questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know anything about Darga the Hutt or the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>No, I’ve been trapped here inside my own head for too long. I’m afraid those names mean absolutely nothing to me.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>You were a Jedi; how did you escape Order 66? </strong>“<em>It wouldn’t surprise me if I was thought to have been killed in battle. It’s likely that this... Empire doesn’t even know that I exist.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Can you help us get you out of here? </strong>“<em>I will do what I can. However, I can already feel panic rising above us. I’d say that by now, they know you’ve set me free.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us anything more about the dark presence you sensed?</strong> “<em>Only that whoever it was seemed to be afraid of me as well. I don’t know who it was, but I sense that he or she is still nearby.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[yCKIn7SvDxjfWhN8]{Jedi Master Denia}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Through the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>As soon as <strong>Denia </strong>was freed from her comatose state, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> sensed it and awoke his Hutt master. <strong>Darga</strong>, unprepared for having a full-fledged Jedi Master on the loose in his <strong>palace</strong>, ordered <strong>Demos </strong>to ready his personal starship for immediate departure and headed to the planet <strong>Bespin</strong> within <strong>minutes</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>remained behind, charged with eliminating the heroes and<strong> Master Denia </strong>as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Igren Demos</strong> is no fool, and though he tries to stop the heroes, he doubts that he can do it alone (see below for more on his plans). Many of the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> guards are mobilized, and a contingent of warriors moves toward the dungeon area to make sure the heroes do not escape with <strong>Denia</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>locks down the doors in the lower guest quarters area and the dungeon area, shutting off power to the turbolift and sealing the blast doors over the stairwell exit up to the guard room. Using a secret passage from <strong>Darga’s throne room</strong> directly to the dungeon level, the guards open the secret door in the hallway outside <strong>Denia’s </strong>chamber just as the heroes emerge.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Out of Captivity</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ifuf0JXwiJJmWe3G]{2-07 Out of Captivity}</strong></p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

From the outside, the doors can be opened only by slicing the computer (using the terminal and scomp link that provides access to the computer).</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Can't Get Out That Way!</h2>\n<p>When the heroes have retrieved <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>(and possibly planted the explosives in the communications center), they likely make their way back to the ventilation grate they used to enter the facility. However, two developments threaten their plans. First, they come upon a disturbing sight—just outside the grate, a large number of <strong>@Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{stormtroopers} </strong>stand around the crumpled body of their <strong>Felucian guide</strong>, and an <strong>@Actor[LLxezY3EqvHI9H7r]{AT-ST}</strong> stomps around the exterior of the facility. Second, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> sends a message over the heroes’ comlinks — the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is operational again, and they can leave the planet whenever they are ready. If the heroes don’t remember the second floor of the facility (which they should have seen from the outside), <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> mentions that some of the Imperials he dealt with mentioned the presence of a command center on the second floor. He suggests that they make their way up there and attempt to reach the roof. From there, they can call <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> for a pickup and avoid the Imperial presence outside.</p>","folder":"4iBdkSX2x86riePC","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

From the command center, <strong>Captain Vischera</strong> monitors the interactions among many Imperial facilities on <strong>Felucia</strong>, including his own.</p>\n<p>The low level of security in the <strong>prison </strong>allows the heroes to move about without <strong>Vischera</strong> knowing exactly where they are, but by the time they reach the second floor, he almost assuredly knows of their presence. Unless the heroes managed to stop all of the Imperials in the facility from sounding an alarm (a difficult prospect, given the layout of the detention block), <strong>Vischera </strong>is waiting for them to arrive, attended by two bodyguards—mutated <strong>Felucians </strong>that have been molded into terrifying fighting machines. See “Command Center” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<p>When the heroes reach the command center, their primary goal should be getting to the <strong>roof</strong>. They can do so via two large platforms that rise up through hatches in the roof, allowing the Imperials to load and unload cargo. Each platform is controlled by a pad embedded in the wall adjacent to it, though the pads must be unlocked by using one of the computer terminals in the room.</p>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>The encounter begins with<strong> Captain Vischera </strong>and <strong>Kargrek</strong>, one of his mutated <strong>Felucian bodyguards</strong>, standing in the southwest corner of the room. <strong>Hagark</strong>, the other bodyguard, stands near the eastern wall, while the <strong>four prison guards</strong> are spaced evenly throughout the command center. At least<strong> two guards</strong> are watching the turbolift cluster when the encounter begins.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in the command center, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Though a four-pod turbolift cluster fills the center of the room, this large chamber—obviously a command center—is alive with activity. Large banks of computers line the walls, showing tactical displays of multiple Imperial facilities, including this one.

Two large cargo platforms sit in one corner of the room, providing access to the roof.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Captain Vischera</h4>\n<p>The cruel genius behind the horrible experiments being conducted on the <strong>Felucians</strong>, <strong>Captain Vischera</strong> is a dangerous man. Slender and with slightly spiky graying hair, <strong>Captain Vischera </strong>has a brilliant mind tainted by a sadistic streak that makes him perfect for Imperial service. <strong>Vischera </strong>has hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, giving the impression that he is malnourished and doesn’t get enough sleep, and his Imperial uniform (though conforming to all standards) looks as though it is hanging off his body. <strong>Vischera </strong>wants nothing more than to continue his experiments, and as such he will defend the facility to his death.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The tall, sickly Imperial officer appears to be in dire need of both food and sleep.

Whenever possible, <strong>Vischera </strong>uses his blaster pistol, taking the <strong>help action</strong> as needed to help the guards hit any heroes who have high AC.</p>\n<h4>Kargrek and Hagark</h4>\n<p>Unaware of the true depth of their mutation, these two <strong>Felucians </strong>have been twisted to believe that they are loyal servants of <strong>Captain Vischera</strong>. Each of them has been horribly altered, even further than the <strong>Felucians </strong>in the <strong>@JournalEntry[e3eojna8O0bdzURu]{Medical Research Bay}</strong>, and both are larger and stronger than all of their brethren. Additionally, <strong>Kargrek </strong>and <strong>Hagark </strong>have received combat training overseen by <strong>Captain Vischera </strong>himself, and as such they are far more dangerous than any other foe in the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</p>\n<p>This towering monstrosity was once a <strong>Felucian</strong>, but now it more closely resembles a beast than a sentient being. Its right arm has been replaced by a bone blade fused into the elbow joint, and its muscles ripple with unnatural strength.

Each <strong>platform </strong>can rise up through the roof. To operate a <strong>platform</strong>, a hero must first use the computer terminal to unlock the platform’s control pad, and then use the pad to raise the platform. It takes <strong>2 rounds</strong> for a platform to move up to the roof.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Command%20Center%20Universal%20VTT.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"525\" /></p>","folder":"NIv6HkZv2u8T9iaX","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

However, <strong>Switch’s </strong>own thugs take pains not to hit <strong>Ganga Lor’s</strong> goons—the Chevin secretly paid them to miss on purpose so that he could take <strong>Switch </strong>down more easily. If <strong>Ganga Lor </strong>sees that the fight is going badly for him, he calls upon <strong>Switch’s</strong> thugs to switch sides, which they do. (This is a good opportunity to increase the challenge of the encounter later in the fight. On the other hand, if the fight is going poorly for the heroes, or if it might go either way, don’t have <strong>Switch’s </strong>thugs change sides at all.)</p>\n<h4>Features of the Area</h4>\n<p><strong>Switch’s</strong> hideout in deep storage bay <strong>V14 </strong>follows along an exhaust conduit running through the bowels of the station. As such, a large chasm cuts through the back of the bay, leading down into the station’s central reactor core. Anyone falling into the chasm is likely killed, taking maximum falling damage and lethal doses of radiation from the reactor core.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the encounter ends, <strong>Switch </strong>thanks the heroes for their assistance and tells them that <strong>Ganga Lor </strong>brought all of his cronies to the fight.

Additionally, a small number of other personnel remain on duty in the area to assist with spotting enemies and, when necessary, defending the turret from the inside.

Gome</strong> has been working for the crime lord for decades now, ever since <strong>Darga</strong> first rose to power, and he is exceptionally good at his job. Unlike others who have benefited from <strong>Darga’s </strong>wealth, <strong>Gome</strong> is mostly indifferent about his work. He seems to have no emotional investment in <strong>Darga’s </strong>crime syndicate and is puzzled by the idea that someone might try to meddle in the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> resides in a small apartment just off of the guest quarters, which serves as both his home and his workspace. The Duros has little daily contact with anyone other than the servants who bring him food and drink, so when the heroes show up at his door, he is more than a bit surprised. (The heroes might be drawn to his apartment by the <strong>loud Neimoidian opera </strong>echoing from behind the door, or because they saw a <strong>Gamorrean guard</strong> from <strong>Darga’s court </strong>bring a transparent bag full of <em>credit sticks</em> to <strong>Gome’s</strong> room.)</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge: Gome</strong> presents a good opportunity for the heroes to learn more about <strong>Darga’s</strong> involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> particularly the nature of what he trades to the Empire. Though <strong>Gome</strong> is surprised to see the heroes, his attitude begins as <strong>indifferent</strong> toward them. If the heroes shift his attitude to friendly through a <strong>DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he is happy to discuss all manner of secrets with them—at least, the ones he knows about. <strong>Gome</strong> is older and probably nearing the end of his days, so he tends to ramble and get distracted. The heroes will need to keep him on track if they are to learn anything from him, so you should portray him as absent-minded to encourage the heroes to steer him back to their conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> knows the following: At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, <strong>Darga</strong> took over a Tibanna gas smuggling ring after its leader was slain by Separatist mercenaries. Since that time, he has managed to increase the amount of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> that is being smuggled away from its normal channels, and the smuggling ring has proven to be his most profitable venture, even ahead of his slave trading. The Empire approached <strong>Darga</strong> a few months ago with an interest in obtaining some of his <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> supplies off the record—though <strong>Gome</strong> recalls that they threatened to bring down the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> crime syndicate if he didn’t play nicely. Since then, <strong>Darga </strong>has been funneling every canister of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> to the Empire for a secret project. The gas, which is refined on the planet <strong>Bespin,</strong> is loaded into large starships and handed over to the Empire in the space above that world. In return, <strong>Darga </strong>receives some kind of goods <strong>(Gome</strong> does not know what), and their transaction is ended. The exchange takes place quickly and seems private because few people even know that Bespin exists; it’s too small to have an Imperial presence. <strong>Darga</strong> has made a handsome profit from the arrangement, and he maintains a remote headquarters in Cloud City, where he can personally oversee the transactions and enjoy the amenities of the floating city.</p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":-50000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

It is a complete story arc that takes in the saga, depth, and emotion of the <em>Star Wars</em> films and translates their core concepts into a unique roleplaying game campaign. Over the course of the campaign, the heroes will liberate worlds from the grip of the Empire, delve into the ancient secrets of the now-extinct Jedi, and feel the bitter taste of betrayal at the hands of a trusted ally.</p>\n<p>This document presents an overview of each adventure and, by extension, the campaign as a whole.

However, this outline should give GMs an idea of the major characters in the campaign and keep them from getting into situations that disrupt continuity.</p>\n<h2>The Traitor’s Gambit</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Rodney Thompson</strong></em></p>\n<p>The story of the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign opens over the Core World of <strong>Brentaal</strong>, on a little space station called <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. After a brush with some agents of <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Bail Organa}</strong>, the heroes find themselves drawn into a conflict with the Empire. Delivering vital information to the Senator on <strong>Alderaan </strong>earns the heroes his trust, and soon<strong> </strong><strong>Bail Organa</strong> sends them on a mission of his own. It seems that a former Imperial Admiral by the name of <strong>@Actor[JJXelfwaesLxl5DV]{Gilder Varth}</strong> has been funneling information about the Empire to the Senator for some months now, though he has gone silent since being arrested and imprisoned on the planet <strong>Felucia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes travel to <strong>Felucia</strong>, encounter some of the natives, and locate the Imperial prison facility where the Admiral is being held. After making their way through the facility, they rescue <strong>Admiral </strong><strong>Gilder Varth</strong> and take him to a safe location. The rescue not only cements the heroes as trustworthy agents (earning them more aid and work from <strong>Bail Organa</strong>) but also marks the first step in building a resistance against the Empire.</p>\n<h2>A Wretched Hive</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Rodney Thompson</strong></em></p>\n<p>Freed by the heroes from the Imperial prison facility, <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> once again begins revealing valuable information on clandestine activities of the Empire. In particular, he mentions that he was responsible for funneling money and resources to something called the “<strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>.” Among those he sent funds to was a Hutt crime lord named <strong>Darga</strong>, who operates out of a ruined city on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Traveling to the <strong>Neimoidian</strong> colony world, the heroes manage to infiltrate <strong>Darga’s</strong> palace and step into a den of vile debauchery. While in the palace, the heroes attempt to obtain more information on the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> while avoiding the wrath of the Hutt gangster.</p>\n<p>The heroes’ searches lead them to a startling discovery: <strong>Darga </strong>has been keeping a Jedi Master and veteran of the Clone Wars in a coma in the dungeons of his palace. After the heroes free <strong>Master Denia</strong>, she helps them deal with the Hutt’s majordomo, a Force-sensitive criminal who has been using the Force to rise in power within <strong>Darga’s </strong>organization. The heroes overhear a conversation between the majordomo and Imperial Inquisitor <strong>Draco</strong>, which introduces them to one of the main villains of the campaign. By the time they handle the majordomo, the Hutt has fled (not wanting to engage in direct conflict with a Jedi Master), and the heroes leave <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The Queen of Air and Darkness</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Rodney Thompson</strong></em></p>\n<p>After dropping <strong>Master Denia</strong> off with their Alderaanian<strong> </strong>allies, the heroes learn that <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> has fled to the famous world of <strong>Bespin</strong>—more specifically, to <strong>Cloud City</strong>. Still needing the information the Hutt possesses, the heroes travel to <strong>Cloud City</strong> only to discover that their quarry has vanished. However, in their search for the crime lord, they discover that another Imperial officer who dealt with the Hutt will be visiting <strong>Cloud City</strong> to take part in its annual <strong>sabacc</strong> tournament.</p>\n<p>The majority of the adventure centers around the tournament. The heroes can choose to enter the tournament, work for the tournament’s administrator as hired help, or simply observe the tournament in order to get close to the dirty officer.</p>\n<p>After a series of event-based encounters, the tournament ends and the heroes convince the Imperial officer to reveal the Hutt’s location. When they go to confront the crime lord, they discover that he’s attempting to make his getaway. The heroes face <strong>Darga </strong>in the hangar bay of his personal luxury yacht and learn the awful truth—the Hutt was using his contacts in the <strong>Tibanna </strong>gas industry to funnel large amounts of the gas to the Empire in exchange for <strong>slaves</strong>.</p>\n<p>In fact, one such transaction was supposed to take place under the cover of the tournament, but the heroes’ involvement spoiled those plans. Now, the Empire is determined to erase any trace of the transaction by crashing a <strong>slave ship</strong> into the <strong>Tibanna </strong>gas hauler in orbit, destroying them both. The heroes, commandeering<strong> Z-95 headhunters</strong>, race against time under fire from Imperial starfighters to stop the crash and save the <strong>slaves</strong>’ lives.</p>\n<h2>Echoes of the Jedi</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Abel G. Peña</strong></em></p>\n<p>After a bout of downtime (during which Gamemasters can insert their own adventures, should they so choose), the heroes are gathered by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. Their encounter with the slave ship over <strong>Bespin </strong>indicates that the Empire is trafficking in slaves, but the slaves were members of a species that <strong>Denia </strong>had never encountered. To discover more about these mysterious slaves (and perhaps unravel the mystery of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>), She sends the heroes to the planet <strong>Almas </strong>in the <strong>Cularin System</strong>, once home to a Jedi academy. There, the heroes must retrieve a lost Jedi <strong>holocron</strong> that can teach <strong>Denia </strong>special <strong>farseeing techniques</strong>, which she hopes will lead her to the mysterious aliens.</p>\n<p>The heroes arrive at <strong>Almas </strong>to find the academy in shambles, having been destroyed from orbit when the Empire rose. The heroes dig their way down through the ruins to reach the academy’s archives. Along the way, they discover that the <strong>dark side</strong> has grown strong in the ruins of the academy, and it has become a domain of evil—much like the cave on <strong>Dagobah </strong>where <strong>Luke </strong>fought the false <strong>Darth Vader</strong>. The heroes face dark side spirits and their own fears as they press onward into the wrecked temple.</p>\n<p>As they approach the archives, they discover that they are not the first to explore the ruins. A small contingent of <strong>Imperial troops</strong> has arrived ahead of them and defends the archives with lethal force. Eventually, the heroes confront the leader of the Imperial contingent, Inquisitor <strong>Draco</strong>. They defeat him and retrieve the <strong>holocron</strong>, which they take back to <strong>Denia</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The First to Strike</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Owen K.C. Stephens</strong></em></p>\n<p>The <strong>holocron </strong>taken from the ruins of the <strong>Almas </strong>academy proves helpful, and <strong>Master Denia</strong> is able to use the Force to locate the mysterious alien slaves. They were members of the <strong>Nazren </strong>species from the planet <strong>Nizon </strong>in the <strong>Maldrood Sector</strong>. The heroes travel to that world to see if they can discover more about the <strong>Nazren</strong>, but they find the planet under Imperial occupation. Even more troubling, the Empire has allowed <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong> to harvest slaves from the planet at will, provided that they also transport some of the slaves to Imperial projects. A core resistance group of <strong>Nazren</strong> has formed, but they seem to be waiting for some kind of catalyst to begin their open opposition. The heroes are just the catalyst they need.</p>\n<p>Working with a charismatic <strong>Nazren </strong>resistance leader in the capital city, the heroes incite a riot against the Imperial oppressors. The city erupts into violence, and the heroes assist the <strong>Nazren </strong>in overthrowing the Imperial invaders, rescuing <strong>Nazren </strong>slaves from <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong>, preventing the riots from claiming innocent lives, and seizing Imperial facilities to help defend the planet. The heroes help the <strong>Nazren </strong>reclaim their world for their own.</p>\n<h2>The Core of Corruption</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Sterling Hershey</strong></em></p>\n<p>While on <strong>Nizon</strong>, the heroes discover Imperial transmissions regarding the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>. The messages indicate that the engineers of the project are in an Imperial facility on <strong>Coruscant</strong>—and that is where the heroes must go. Traveling to Imperial Center, the heroes sneak past the world’s defenses and take their first steps on the capital planet of the <strong>Galactic Empire</strong>. Under the watchful eye of the Empire, the heroes pinpoint the location of the <strong>project’s architects</strong> and travel to a massive skyscraper still under construction.</p>\n<p>Moving up through the skyscraper, the heroes soon come face to face with the <strong>engineers </strong>of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>. Unfortunately, they are all being watched by several members of the <strong>Inquisitorius</strong>, who fight the heroes to the death. When their defeat seems imminent, the <strong>Inquisitors </strong>detonate explosives at the base of the skyscraper, which begins to collapse. The heroes must fight their way back out of the collapsing building and make their way to safety.</p>\n<p>However, the heroes finally learn the details of the<strong> Sarlacc Project</strong>. The Empire is constructing a massive new starship <strong>12 kilometers long</strong>— many times larger than a <strong>Star Destroyer</strong>, and an early prototype (though not the final version) of the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. The new vessel will serve as the flagship of the Imperial fleet, and the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> nears completion.</p>\n<h2>A Reckoning of Wraiths</h2>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">By Rodney Thompson</span></strong></em></p>\n<p>After transmitting their knowledge of the project to <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> agents, the heroes are instructed to make contact with a group of loyalists in <strong>Coruscant’s</strong> seedy underbelly. When they arrive at the meeting location, however, they discover that the loyalists are all dead. The heroes return to their safe house—only to fall into a trap set by the Empire! Fighting their way back to their ship, the heroes find the hangar being defended by a massive <strong>AT-AT</strong>. They must bring the <strong>AT-AT</strong> down (using whatever means necessary) before they can board their ship.</p>\n<p>Blasting their way out of <strong>Coruscant</strong>, the heroes arrive at a rendezvous point where a <strong>Nebulon-B frigate </strong>(the <strong><em>Resurgence</em></strong>) waits for them. Unfortunately, when they arrive, they learn that the trap was sprung not only on them but also on their allies. As an <strong>Imperial Star Destroyer </strong>pounds on the <em>Resurgence’s </em>shields, the heroes board the <strong>Nebulon-B </strong>and try to rescue survivors. Battling an <strong>Imperial boarding party</strong> on the ship, they fight their way to the main launch bay just in time to see <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong>—apparently still alive after the confrontation on Almas, and now cybernetically enhanced—dragging <strong>Master Denia</strong> into his shuttle.</p>\n<p>As <strong>Draco </strong>blasts off, the heroes must flee the crumbling ship and make their way into hyperspace. Worse, as they blast their way free of the exploding <strong><em>Resurgence</em></strong>, they discover the architect of their betrayal: <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>. They receive a transmission from the Admiral aboard the <strong>Imperial Star Destroyer</strong>, who reveals that he has merely been trying to uncover <strong>Organa’s </strong>treachery all along. The heroes manage to escape the Empire, but only after suffering grievous losses.</p>\n<h2>The Gem of Alderaan</h2>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">By Gary M. Sarli</span></strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Following their betrayal at the hands of <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, the heroes spend some time on the run from the Empire (again allowing the Gamemaster to insert other adventures). Eventually, word reaches the heroes that they have been summoned back to <strong>Alderaan </strong>by <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. <strong>Senator Organa</strong> has learned that<strong> Master Denia</strong> was taken to the planet <strong>Prakith</strong>, in the <strong>Deep Core</strong>, and that reaching her will be nearly impossible thanks to Imperial security along those <strong>hyperlanes</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, the heroes learn that <strong>Lady Alya Aldrete</strong>, an <strong>Alderaanian noble</strong>, might have the means of getting them to the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. Apparently,<strong> Lady Alya</strong> employs smugglers, and she has managed to obtain passage for them through the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. She is the guest of honor on the first run of a new high-speed repulsortrain leaving the city of <strong>Aldera </strong>for a six-hour trip. The heroes board the repulsortrain and try to get an audience with <strong>Lady Alya</strong>, with little success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Things turn sour quickly when a group of mercenaries attacks the repulsortrain. The heroes must deal with the mercenaries and protect the noblewoman to get the help they need.

This adventure is the midpoint of the overall campaign and represents a shift from investigating to actually taking on Imperial forces—and winning. Though a serious of rough and action-filled encounters, the heroes should advance to 11th level by the conclusion of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will free a planet from Imperial tyranny, become allies with some of that planet’s leaders, and discover that the trail to the Sarlacc Project leads right into the heart of the Empire—to Coruscant itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IS DAWN OF DEFIANCE?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dawn of Defiance is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the adventures in the Dawn of Defiance campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic SW5e experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The Dawn of Defiance campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Dawn of Defiance adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Warning! If you will be playing in a Dawn of Defiance campaign or in a campaign utilizing its adventures, read no further.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ADVENTURE SUMMARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After weeks of meditation and study, Master Denia once more calls the heroes together with news. The meditation techniques she learned from the holocron have proven to be helpful, and she believes that she has located the home planet of the slaves the heroes rescued in The Queen of Air and Darkness. After consulting the Force, she believes that the alien slaves were in fact Nazren, a species from Nizon, an obscure planet in the Maldrood Sector.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A special request by Senator Organa to the University of Aldera revealed only that the planet Nizon is a barren world in the Centares System. It lies near Centares, an industrial world occupied by the Empire from which Imperial forces have been withdrawing for some months now. Captain Verana has managed to locate Nizon in his navcomputer and is willing to share the coordinates with the heroes if they agree to investigate the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARRIVAL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in the Centares System, they discover an Imperial presence not so lessened as they would like to believe. A Victory II-class Star Destroyer floats in orbit, and a number of smaller capital ships and corvettes dot the space above Nizon. As the heroes arrive, they witness a transport ship (similar to the slave ship from The Queen of Air and Darkness) leave Nizon’s orbit and jump to hyperspace for parts unknown. Slipping past the Imperial Navy will not be easy; the heroes are fired upon for violating Imperial space. To make matters worse, the space around Nizon is filled with fragmentary asteroids, known as rogue fragments, that pose a constant danger to anyone without access to the tracking information being broadcast from the planet’s surface.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the heroes land (or crash) on Nizon, it soon becomes clear that their help is sorely needed. Nizon is a barren world covered in dirty red clay with powerful gusts of wind. The gales kick up dust storms that make the planet barely habitable, and the heroes are required to wear breath masks to filter out the dust. The Nazren’s only major city lies not far from the heroes’ vessel and should be a natural place for them to begin their search for information.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE LAY OF THE LAND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inside the city, the heroes discover that Imperial oppression is alive and well on Nizon; stormtroopers march down the streets, an AT-ST walks around the wider avenues, and V-wing starfighters scream overhead every now and again. The Nazren themselves, hulking beings comparable in size to Wookiees, lumber through the streets with their shoulders hunched and their eyes downcast, but a smoldering look of hatred boils just below their stoic surfaces. In addition to the Nazren and the Imperials, Trandoshan slavers prod groups of Nazren along or gather at the entrances to buildings, eyeing the Nazren like farmers eyeing cattle. Other species are present in the city, too, allowing the heroes to move through the streets without being accosted at every turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes eventually make contact with Sartok, the leader of an underground resistance movement. The Nazren have been planning to overthrow their Imperial masters for a while, but thus far, Sartok has been unable to convince enough of his people that it is possible to defeat the Empire and reclaim their world. After learning of the heroes’ previous successes against the Empire, Sartok pleads with them to help him reclaim the capital city, which should inspire his people to continue their rebellion. If the heroes agree, he fills them in on his plans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RESISTANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Sartok gives the word, his allies throughout the city begin to riot. The heroes tackle a number of encounters during the riots that aid the Nazren in their struggles to reclaim their capital. They must help capture an Imperial checkpoint, rescue Nazren children trapped in a collapsing building, stop Trandoshan slavers from herding frightened Nazren onto their space ship, and so on. The critical battle of the revolt takes place in Martyr’s Plaza, which contains the entrance to the planetary control center, which runs all global communications as well as the rogue fragment tracking station.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Moreover, the heroes face one other unforeseen challenge: a bounty hunter. Inquisitor Valin Draco posted a bounty on the heroes after their last encounter, and a Zabrak named Vril Vrakth has been on their trail for a few weeks. Having learned about Senator Organa’s request to the University of Aldera, Vrakth has set himself up on Nizon as a scout for the Imperials and the slavers, but the heroes are his true prey. The bounty hunter plans to capture the heroes and kill Sartok, who also has a bounty on his head (though his is “dead or alive”). Vrakth has crab droids from the Clone Wars crawling through the city, reporting anything they find and attacking his prey when possible. If the heroes don’t deal with him prior to their capture of the control center, they must face Vrakth outside the city, at a planetary defense battery being installed by the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the capital city securely in the hands of the Nazren rebels, word begins to come in that Nazren in other settlements have begun their own uprising. Meanwhile, the heroes gain access to an Imperial intelligence datachip that was entrusted to Vril Vrakth. From this datachip, they learn that the Nazren slaves were used as a part of the Sarlacc Project, and that every so often, the slaves were executed to keep them from spreading word of the project. Additionally, the datachip indicates that the orders regarding the Sarlacc Project originate from Coruscant, which is also referred to as the home of the project’s designers and architects. Thus, the best source of information on the Sarlacc Project seems to be one of the most heavily guarded planets in the galaxy. With this knowledge in hand, the heroes return to the Resurgence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OPENING CRAWL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS : DAWN OF DEFIANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Episode V: The First to Strike</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is a time of rebellion in the galaxy. Members of the Alderaanian resistance have won a major victory against the Empire, and more battles are close at hand.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Empire’s mistreatment of non-Humans continues throughout the galaxy, as Wookiees, Mon Calamari, and other species are forced to work as slaves on Imperial projects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aboard the Resurgence, Master Denia has peered into the Force and discovered another group of oppressed beings, ones who might hold the key to unlocking the mystery of the Sarlacc Project . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 1: WHISPERS IN THE FORCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some weeks after their last mission, Denia asks the heroes to come speak to her about things they have encountered before, especially the slave ship from The Queen of Air and Darkness. After seeing to their needs and seating them comfortably, she speaks to the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Thank you for coming. I know that you have many demands on your time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“As I had hoped, my training with the holocron has proven very useful, and I thank you again for your assistance in recovering it. With its aid, I have deepened and lengthened my meditations and have begun to understand the glimpses I receive with greater accuracy. Unfortunately, the galaxy is filled with great suffering, and the cries of whole worlds oppressed come through the Force most clearly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“In particular, I have been hearing cries for help from what I believe to be the homeworld of the slaves you freed from the Imperials. Having seen and heard them more clearly, I now believe these prisoners were Nazren, a species from Centares, an obscure system in the Malrood Sector. I passed this information to Senator Organa, and he sent a few discreet inquiries to Aldera University.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“It seems that the Nazren are a species from outside the Empire. They never joined the Republic and thus have no representation in the Senate. The Empire has a small force on the mining planet Centares, the third world in the Centares System, but has been reassigning those ships for some weeks. The Nazren are native to Nizon, the fifth planet in the system. Since the Empire has no official interest in Nizon, it seems likely that they have made raids on Nizon for slave labor, perhaps originally to run the mines on Centares. But they might have left some records or clues on Nizon about the Sarlacc Project. Also, the people of Nizon might make useful allies if the Empire has mistreated them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Though there is little information about Centares or Nizon in our records, Captain Verana has managed to locate hyperspace coordinates for Nizon in his navcomputer. He’s willing to share them with you—if you’re willing to travel there. I ask that you take a trip to Nizon and investigate its treatment at the hands of the Empire. Proof of Imperial depredations might give Senator Organa additional influence in the Senate, and if the Nizon are interested in opposing the Empire on a widespread basis, we might be able to assist them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After speaking to Denia, the heroes are likely to have numerous questions. Denia admits that she has few hard facts, but her sense through the Force is that the Nazren are suffering in a way that could be stopped, and that the heroes will find something worth their time. Here are some possible answers to questions that the heroes might ask.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why don’t you go yourself, or at least come with us? “Though this is one of the strongest visions I have had in my meditations, it is far from the only tremor I have sensed in the Force. I need to remain here for some weeks yet to meditate on these feelings and try to clarify them. Unfortunately, I feel that the threat—and the opportunity—on Nizon cannot wait for me to be ready. That’s why I ask you, my trusted friends.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is Centares or Nizon like? “We don’t have much information about them. Both are apparently very dusty planets, and I can provide breath masks for any of you that don’t already have them. There is a single mining operation on Centares, with no native life, and one major city on Nazren. That’s all we know.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What kind of opposition are we likely to face? “The Empire has been removing its forces from Centares for some time; that much is clear through reports filed with the Senate. It has no official presence on Nizon, but I sense that some threat does lurk there. I can’t give you more advice than this: Be cautious, and don’t grow overconfident.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What’s in it for us? Hopefully, by now you know your players well enough to know if they need more incentives than an opportunity for adventure and a chance to oppose the Empire. If they do need a financial motive, Denia provides one: “Senator Organa is willing to pay each of you 4,000 credits just for making the trip. If you find the information that I sense waits there, he will reward you for recovering that as well.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: INTO THE JAWS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first arc of the adventure involves getting past Imperial forces and finding someone to talk to on Nizon. Stealth and speed will serve the heroes well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE CENTARES SYSTEM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Centares system has seven planets. The first and second are a gas giant and a toxic ocean, respectively, and an asteroid belt separates them from the rest of the system. The third planet is Centares, the fourth is another gas giant, the fifth is Nizon, the sixth is barren, and the seventh is yet another gas giant. Fragments from the asteroid belt have spread throughout the system, such that several worlds (including Nizon) are surrounded by asteroid rings and clouds of dust and debris. The clouds are thickest as they reach the upper atmosphere of these worlds, wreathing them in dirty halos. The clouds are not solid, however, and a few thin pathways through them allow access to the planets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes drop out of hyperspace in the Centares System, they find the Imperial presence not so much lessened as moved. There aren’t many Imperial ships around Centares, which is the only official reason for anyone to be here. However, there is a surprising amount of activity around Nizon. Assuming that the heroes jumped out of hyperspace near Nizon (their ultimate destination), a DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check can pinpoint the ships that remain around Centares—a Venator-class Star Destroyer with a half complement of starfighters and its escorts, and two Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers. The forces around Nizon are more extensive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a deployed operator makes a DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check, read the following information.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chatter over the transceiver reveals additional ships in the system. At least two other Star Destroyers are in orbit around Nizon, though nowhere near your position. Dozens of starfighters, mostly V-wings and V-19 Torrent models, are also in orbit around the planet. A few other ships, including bulk carriers and personal starships, are flying about in the planet’s atmosphere, below the dust cloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At least one ship still orbits Centares, maintaining an Imperial presence there. From the sound of the chatter, it’s another old Star Destroyer design, though perhaps a bigger design. Whatever it is, you don’t want to be sitting in orbit if it decides to investigate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIZON SPACE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The players start 500 feet away from the Arkanian Dragon and the 4 V-Wing's acting as an escort and the dust cloud is behind the Arkanian Dragon and is 2,000 feet deep.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the players exit hyperspace and approach Nizon, read the following text aloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hyperspace fades, and the stars find their rightful positions again as you arrive in the Centares System, far enough from Centares to avoid any starship with sensors sharp enough to find you. A Message to Spacers broadcasts automatically, warning travelers to be cautious of rogue meteor fragments. You can see that the system has seven planets, many of which are ringed by fragments from a large asteroid belt between the second and third planets. Centares and Nizon sit within asteroids, too, but they’re also cloaked by dust clouds. There’s a lot of rock in nearby space.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Then all of your ship’s sensors and warning alarms go off at once, and it’s easy to see why. Between you and Nizon, emerging from the dust cloud that surrounds the world, is a Star Destroyer! It’s an older, smaller model than the new Imperial class that the Empire is producing, but it’s still a fully functional capital ship, with an escort of V-wing fighters. Having just escorted a Gallofree Yards Medium Transport out of Nizon’s orbit, the Star Destroyer turns and heads toward you. The Imperial ship makes no effort to communicate with you, and its approach is direct—and hostile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE ARKANIAN DRAGON (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Victory II-class Star Destroyer, the Arkanian Dragon controls access to space around Nizon. It is currently escorting a transport ship (similar to the slave ship from The Queen of Air and Darkness) out of the planet’s orbit, at which point the transport jumps into hyperspace. The heroes’ ship has no cover and no business being in the Centares System, so the Arkanian Dragon immediately orders them to stop and prepare to be boarded. Presumably, the heroes refuse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is likely the first time that the heroes have had to confront a Star Destroyer directly, so you should warn them of the danger of trying to defeat such a ship. It’s also important for them to learn that the Arkanian Dragon can’t land or operate in the atmosphere of Nizon. It’s bound to the reaches of space, so if the heroes can get past the ship and through the dust cloud that surrounds the planet, they can escape its attentions. Doing so, however, requires the heroes to fight their way past the Star Destroyer and its complement of starfighters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sixteen of the Arkanian Dragon’s V-wing fighters are deployed elsewhere around Nizon, out of range of this battle. Of the remaining eight, the captain of the Star Destroyer opts to keep four in reserve (in case the heroes are just a diversion) and sends four out after the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE ARKANIAN DRAGON TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Arkanian Dragon is only truly afraid of capital ships and will attempt to engage the player's ships without hesitation though if it feels threatened by the players sufficiently, it will deploy the remaining 4 V-wings to save itself. The Arkanian Dragon cannot operate in atmosphere or land on the ground so if the players manage to get through the dust cloud, it will be forced to stop chasing them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"THE ARKANIAN DRAGON\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VICTORY-II CLASS STAR DESTROYER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tier 2 huge starship, unaligned, Battleship role</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 13 (reinforced)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 127 (11d12+55)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shield Points 127 (directional)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shield Regeneration Rate 12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 150 ft., turning 300 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 10 (+0) 18 (+4) 18 (+4) 11 (+0) 14 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Strength +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Piloting +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sense Blindsight 1,000 ft</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARMAMENT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FORWARD-FACING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heavy Laser Battery (2) Ion Battery (1) Laser Battery (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PORT-FACING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heavy Laser Battery (1) Ion Battery (1) Laser Battery (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STARBOARD-FACING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heavy Laser Battery (1) Ion Battery (1) Laser Battery (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ship can take up to four non-attack actions as well as many attack actions as it has weapon hardpoints.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heavy Ion Cannon. (2/maintenance) The Arkanian Dragon can fire the heavy ion cannon at a target as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a forward firing arc. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a deployed mechanic can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If the target ship rolls a 1 on the saving throw to avoid the weapon’s effects; or when the target ship has disadvantage on the saving throw and fails, the Arkanian Dragon can force the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the ship is ionized until the start of the Arkanian Dragon's next turn. If the damaged ship is gargantuan, it has advantage on the saving throw.

(2/maintenance) The Arkanian Dragon can activate a tractor beam as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a forward firing arc. Each ship within the firing arc must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a ship is tractored for 1 minute and immediately gets pulled 100 feet towards the tractoring ship, without changing the ship’s orientation. At the start of each of a tractored ship’s pilot’s turns, a tractored ship gets pulled 100 feet towards the tractoring ship, without changing the ship’s orientation, and then repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If a ship of medium or smaller size is tractored, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If a ship of gargantuan size is tractored, it instead has advantage. If the Blood Brother attempts to tractor a ship larger than it, and the ship succeeds on the saving throw, it can instead use the tractor beam to tractor itself to the ship, gaining the tractored condition. The Arkanian Dragon can end the tractor beam at any time (no action required).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Control.

The V-wings are also receiving tracking information from the sueface below meaning that they do not have to make checks to navigate the dust cloud but it is still difficult terrain. If the players manage to escape the Arkanian Dragon the V-wings break off and return to it, unwilling to continue without support or risk the safety of their parent ship on what could possibly be a diversion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are three possible outcomes. In the event the players manage to escape the Arkanian Dragon and its escort, they are not chased further and can see there is only one major city anywhere on the surface and plenty of places to hide their ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although unlikely, it’s possible that the heroes—through great skill, great luck, or more firepower than the adventure is designed for—destroy the Arkanian Dragon and enough of its escorts to take control of the star system. If this happens, you as the GM have two basic options. First, you can run the adventure as written, but allow the PCs to use their starship as a weapon during the riots on Nizon. They can’t bypass certain encounters (for example, finding Sartok is possible only on foot, and the Imperial ground troops don’t evaporate just because their support ship is gone), but a functioning starship makes other encounters (such as the Battle for Martyr’s Plaza) much less challenging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can have Imperial reinforcements arrive within a few hours of the Dragon’s destruction. The Empire has been regularly moving material between a nearby industrial world and Nizon, and a missed hourly status check from the Arkanian Dragon can bring more Star Destroyers to secure the system. These starships can be as heavy and as numerous as you need to prevent the heroes from feeling confident enough to fly their ship around during the rioting. A Venator class Star Destroyer and its escorts should be more than enough to get the most hardened aces to land and keep their ship under cover until the planet is secured (especially since they are unlikely to have defeated the Arkanian Dragon without suffering serious damage). Once the control center has been captured and the planet is in Nazren hands, any remaining Imperial space forces evacuate to carry word of the defeat back to Coruscant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The third and final outcome is the Arkanian Dragon defeats the heroes. This adventure changes very little. If the heroes’ ship is destroyed, inform the players that they have been shot down and crash outside a large city, and proceed with the adventure normally. If the heroes are captured, the Dragon’s captain informs them that a bounty hunter is looking for them, and the Empire is inclined to turn them over. The heroes are placed in a detention camp, where Sartok finds and rescues them before asking for their help to free his world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Almost any map size is acceptable as long as players have the freedom to move around, get past the Star Destroyer and enter Nizon's atmosphere through the dust cloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The space around Nizon is filled with a thick cloud of dust and rogue asteroid fragments that can do serious damage to a starship with very little warning, filling a 2000 foot area between the atmosphere of the planet and</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The cloud is considered difficult terrain and ships entering the cloud for the first time on their turn or ending their turn in the cloud must make a DC 16 Intelligence (Piloting) check to avoid hitting a rogue fragment and taking damage. On a failed roll, the starship collides with a meteor fragment and takes 3d10 kinetic damage. The dust clouds also cause poor visibility, causing all ships inside the cloud to be lightly obscured and be granted half cover.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LANDING SITE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes are within Nizon’s atmosphere, visibility clears up slightly. Any effort to scan the surface visually or listen to incoming communications reveals that there is only one major city on the whole planet. When the heroes begin to examine the city or look for a place to land, read the following text.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city is a major metropolis, but it’s also the only big city you find anywhere. You can see starship traffic, proving that the city has a spaceport—most likely, the only one on the planet. The city is built on a flat, rocky region between a large mountain and rough badlands of valleys and hills. There is construction on the mountain overlooking the city, but from here it’s impossible to tell exactly what’s being built.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Starship traffic is regular enough to suggest the presence of more than just Imperial forces and the local population. A few small freighters, manufactured by numerous different companies, are landing or taking off. Given that they lack any sign of Imperial markings or identification broadcasts, they are probably privately owned, meaning that at least a few members of other species will be found in the city, making it easier for you to move around there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though they are nowhere near you, you pick up transceiver broadcasts from patrols on the far side of the city. If you want your ship to remain undiscovered, you’ll have to make some effort to conceal it once you land.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: The heroes must prevent their ship from being spotted by Imperial ground patrols or V-wing flyovers. The high level of dust and poor visibility will help, but additional action is required.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the players make a Wisdom (Survival) check to conceal the ship, keep track of this check. Each day, allow local patrols to make a Wisdom (Perception) check with at +5. On any successful check, the starship is found and placed under guard (until the Empire is forced to withdraw from the system). In the first fight to take place on the day their ship is discovered, the heroes face an additional crab droid from Vril Vrakth’s forces. The crab droid carries something that it took from the heroes’ ship, which was used by Vrakth to guess their plans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Many caves and valleys can be used to conceal their ship, but getting into these locations is tricky at best. If the heroes’ ship has crashed, the caves and valleys aren’t an option. If the heroes land under their own power, they can try these difficult landing spots. A valley landing requires a DC 18 Intelligence (Piloting) check and gives disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks to find the ship. A DC 22 Intelligence (Piloting) check allows the heroes to land deep in the back of a cave, which ensures that no one will find their starship for at least several days (which should cover the timeframe of the adventure). Characters might wish to rig some kind of tarp or wall to hide their starship, constructed from local material or appropriate camouflage they bring with them. Doing so will also grant advantage to any Wisdom (Survival) checks to hide the ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: Nizon is an inhospitable planet. Visibility on the surface is limited, the native dust makes it difficult to breathe without assistance, and it’s easy to get lost. Since the heroes are unlikely to have landed within sight of the city, they must make their way there from the outer reaches of the badlands without being spotted or getting lost. Doing this successfully requires a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. If one or more heroes does not have a breath mask of some kind, the DC of the Survival check increases by 5. On a failed check, the heroes either get lost or are forced to take cover from the worst of the dust, losing a day of travel time. This increases the chances that their starship is discovered and that they’ll encounter crab droids deployed by Vrakth. If the heroes take more than two days to reach the city, they run into one crab droid in the badlands each day until they make it to the city.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: Though inhospitable, Nizon is not lifeless. Tough and dangerous predators prowl the rough badlands and hunt the recessed valleys. The most dangerous of these is the blade scorpion, a massive creature that combines the worst traits of a crab and a spider. The Nazren fear these beasts and never travel alone in regions where they are common. The creatures are one reason that the bounty hunter Vrakth chooses to employ crab droids on the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each day that the heroes are in the badlands (including their first day), make a Wisdom (Perception) check from a Blade Scorpion against the worst Dexterity (Stealth) check of any hero in the group. If the Blade Scorpion's check is higher, it picks up their scent and attacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The statblocks for the crab droid and Blade Scorpion are below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LM-432 \"MUCKRAKER\" CRAB DROID</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Large droid, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 17 (armorplast shielding)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 77 (9d10+27)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 9 (-1) 17 (+3) 10 (+0) 14 (+2) 8 (-1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +6, Con +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +6, Survival +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities ion</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances necrotic, poison, psychic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities poisoned, diseased</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Binary, Galactic Basic but can't speak it</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 3 (700 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Blindspot.

The crab droid jet-sprays the contents of its mud tank onto a space within 30 feet, turning that space into difficult terrain, and forcing any creatures standing on it to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net’s effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, the blade scorpion can make no further attacks with it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE CITY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city of the Nazren has no name. None is needed, as it is the only settlement larger than a town on the entire planet. The Nazren refer to it as ahdjok, but this is nothing more than their word for “city,” and the Empire hasn’t bothered to assign it a name. Its position behind Mount Antas protects the city from the worst of the planetary dust, and it has a large, flat area on which to build a spaceport. As a result, the city has been the main point of contact between the Nazren and offworlders. It sits atop an underground river, which provides an endless supply of fresh water. This, combined with offworld trade, allowed the city to grow much larger than local agricultural conditions would otherwise permit. It is a traditional pilgrimage site for Nazren worldwide, making it a convenient location for the Empire to gather slaves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city is sprawling, with 10- to 15-story buildings crowded around wide streets and public fountains. Most of the city looks old, constructed of stone and natural caverns. Ancient statues of rock and ornate decorative carvings are worked into most buildings, and even the roads are paved with carved stones. More modern constructions can also be seen, mostly watch-posts bolted onto buildings or gates that block access to some streets. Posters, wanted signs, and recruitment fliers for the Empire have been plastered everywhere, ugly debris atop the city’s natural charm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most of the creatures you see are obviously locals, the Nazren. None seem to carry weapons, not even something as crude as a knife or club. Their heads are generally downcast and their shoulders slumped, but whenever one glances at an Imperial poster or flyer, it looks up, and a flash of hatred shows briefly in its eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though much less common, aliens from dozens of worlds also walk through the streets. Most are followed by one or two Nazren carrying heavy bundles of goods. The aliens go by without comment and are diverse enough that you see no reason your own appearance should draw unwanted attention.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Imperial presence here is also obvious. Stormtroopers in small groups patrol openly through the city, and in the distance you can hear the mechanical stomp of military walkers, though nothing as big as an AT-AT would fit in the streets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: Now that the heroes are in the city, they need to learn what’s going on and what they can do about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The easiest option is to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. A result of 10 to 14 reveals that the Empire took control of the city about a year go and has been shipping Nazren off as slaves ever since, mostly with Trandoshan slavers. It also reveals that any Nazren who resists the Empire is placed in a detainment camp in the center of town, and thus, most Nazren leaders are now in that camp.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A check result of 15 to 19 also reveals that many Nazren are prepared to fight back as soon as they receive a signal from Sartok, a Nazren leader recently arrested and thrown into the detainment camp. However, the Empire doesn’t realize that Sartok is anyone special.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A check result of 20 or more also reveals that a bounty hunter named Vril Vrakth has recently arrived on Nizon with a collection of old crab droids. Most people think that Vrakth is hunting Sartok (which is true), but they note that he keeps asking about newcomers, and that he seems to have the aid of Imperial troops. Many believe that Vrakth is chasing an Imperial bounty on a non-Nazren target (which is also true; the Zabrak was hired by Inquisitor Draco to find the heroes).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A hero could also attempt to gain this information from an Imperial administrator or slaver by making a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. The DC for either is only 12, and reveals the same amount of information as a result of 10 to 14 for the Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With a DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check, a hero can slice into the local datastreams and pick up broadcasts from Imperials and Nazren insurgents (with the same results as the Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: The oppression the Nazren suffer is obvious, and patrols of stormtroopers march through the streets. At a dramatically appropriate point, the heroes see six heavy stormtroopers kick down the door of a building and drag a screaming Nazren mother out of the house. If the heroes do nothing, the mother is hauled off, and the cries of a Nazren child can be heard within the structure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes fight the stormtroopers, the real challenge is to be fast and quiet. If the heroes defeat the stormtroopers silently or in 1 or 2 rounds, no one reports the fight. If the fight is noisy and lasts for 3 or more rounds, someone calls more stormtroopers. A squad of six more arrives in 2 minutes, a group of 12 arrives in 5 minutes, and an AT-ST arrives in 10 minutes. use the Heavy Trooper statblock from Scum and Villainy for these troopers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes manage to keep mother and child together, give them inspiration as a bonus. If the mother is saved, she says that Sartok will wish to talk to the heroes, but she is too fearful to answer questions about the resistance leader, other than to choke out “detainment camp.” She then runs off to go into hiding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE NAZREN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nazren are tall humanoids, approximately the same height as Wookiees, but broader at the shoulders and narrower at the hip, with longer arms and torsos but shorter legs. They are hairless, with thick skin that has a heavy hide or leather look. They are brown to light yellow in color, a natural camouflage for their dust-bowl world. The head of a Nazren has no nose and is flatter than a Human's. A prominent brow ridge protects their eyes, and a series of small knobs start at the back of the head and run down to a visible spine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nazren wear sleeveless tunics tucked into black hide pants and heavy boots. Their clothes are normally fastened with hooks or clamps on the end of short lengths of cord or attached belts. Pads that strap onto the shoulders (to cushion a heavy load) and arm bracers are common, also attached with the hook system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: INSURRECTION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eventually, it should be clear to the heroes that their best chance to help the Nazren and gain information about the Imperial forces is to rescue Sartok from the detention camp. The camp is easy to find because it takes up the center of town, which used to be an open market before the Empire shut it down. The heroes’ attack on the camp is critical to the rest of the adventure. It is a challenge that can likely only be overcome only through battle—an important evolution from the stealth and investigation of the early stages of the Dawn of Defiance campaign to the beginning of open opposition to the Empire, of course if the players have a sufficiently good plan it should be allowed. It is also where the heroes first encounter Sartok, who will guide them in the rest of the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes don’t seem inclined to free Sartok from the detention camp, you might need to encourage them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they have befriended any characters in the city, that character can be grabbed and thrown into the camp.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they are focused on finding and stealing information from the Empire, let them overhear that a data slicer working for Sartok was thrown in the camp. Once the heroes get inside, they find only Sartok, who promises to share the slicer’s information if the heroes help with the coming riots.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they seem worried about particular Imperial forces (such as the AT-STs), let them see those forces head out to patrol several hours away from the city, creating a window of opportunity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they think that the Nazren in the camp are safe, at least temporarily, have stormtroopers start to post execution times for the next day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes attack the camp, run “The Breakout” encounter below. If they simply refuse to get involved, Sartok escapes on his own after a few days and seeks the heroes to propose an alliance between them. In that case, skip “The Breakout” encounter and proceed with the adventure without this encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE BREAKOUT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The detainment camp has a 30 foot tall wall around it, with a single 10 foot wide gate in the middle of the northern wall. There are four 40 foot tall towers, one at each corner of the yard. Each tower contains two experienced heavy weapons stormtroopers. Being in the towers gives the stormtroopers three quarters cover and a clear shot at any target in the yard. There are 20 to 30 Nazren in the yard, most huddled together in the center, away from the walls and gate. Two Nek dogs patrol the inside of the yard, but they don’t get closer than 10 feet from any of the Nazren.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes scout the detention camp, read the following text.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are several small yards near the center of town, but these are clearly only for the elderly and very young. They have few guards and low walls, and the Nazren within them seem unlikely to be able to run even if unguarded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The central detainment yard is different. 100 feet on a side, it is a large square enclosed by a tall stone wall, which looks like it was built from the rubble of collapsed buildings. A metal gate in the north wall of the yard controls access and is apparently remotely operated. There are four guard towers, one at each corner of the yard, with two heavily armed stormtroopers in each. Two vicious, cybernetically enhanced Nek dogs patrol the inside of the yard, growling at the prisoners without getting too close to them. Most of the Nazren huddle together in the center of the yard, but you notice one captive keeping an eye on the others and moving around the outside of the group to stay between them and the Nek dogs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GUARD TROOPER (8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GUARD TROOPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid, lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 17 (assault armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 30 (3d8+12)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15 (+2) 16 (+3) 17 (+3) 9 (-1) 10 (+0) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Atheltics +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 10</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assault Cannon.

With heavy weapons, a clear field of fire, and fortified positions, the stormtroopers simply shoot at any characters breaking in or out. Most of the Nazren throw themselves prone when any fighting starts (so as not to get in Sartok’s way) and are ignored by the stormtroopers. This also prevents the tower guards from going after the heroes immediately, as they must continue to watch the prisoners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The stormtroopers who are free to engage the heroes move onto the stone wall around the yard to get closer to any heroes shooting or escaping.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Nek battle dogs attack heroes who have melee weapons over those who have ranged weapons. If a character tries to leave the yard, the nearest Nek dog attempts to grapple that character. The creatures fight only until they have lost half of their hit points. After that, they retreat and do not attack unless threatened.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any prisoners escape from the yard, reinforcements a squad of 8 more guard troopers are dispatched to track and recapture them. It takes the reinforcements 5 minutes to muster and reach the detention camp. If the heroes are willing to be led by Sartok, he guides them through a series of caves (parts of the underground river that ran dry decades ago) to a particular hidden cavern. If they refuse, Sartok follows them and offers his aid once the reinforcements track them down. After that, the heroes can find any place to hole up as long as they stay off the streets. Within hours, their faces are plastered on posters all over the city.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The outer wall of the yard is made of 5 feet-thick stone (DR 10, 250 hit points per 5 feet section). The gate is neutronium-reinforced lanthanide, but much thinner (DR 15, 75 hit points). A breaching charge can be used instead of attacking the wall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gravity plates have been placed 5 feet underground around each tower. Within 10 feet of a tower the gravity is incredibly high, counting as difficult terrain but giving any creature in that area advantage on Strength saving throws to be moved. A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to notice the effects of the gravity plates at range, and a DC 18 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check is required to disable a plate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NUTURING A REVOLT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes allow Sartok to lead them to his safe cavern, the resistance leader picks up a few cached belongings and asks his guests to sit comfortably. At this point, Sartok is dressed as humbly as any Nazren, but he carries a satchel over one shoulder, in which he keeps a hidden blaster. The second and fourth fingers are missing from his left hand, and he has numerous scars, including some across his face. He is darker brown than most Nazren, with lighter splotches of skin at his wrinkles and creases. As an older member of his species, he has seen much that he'd rather not have witnessed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes have any pressing needs (such as treating serious injuries), Sartok helps see to them before speaking.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sartok makes a quick sweep of the cavern, checking to ensure that it has not been disturbed. Apparently satisfied, he crouches by the simple fire and motions for you to sit. He takes a few long breaths, then turns and speaks to you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“My world is enslaved, and we have come to realize that no negotiation or appeal to reason can free us. The only way we shall regain control of Nizon is to take it back by force, which requires us to face the weapons and training of the Empire. That battle must begin here—all other settlements look to us for inspiration and leadership. For the sake of our world, we must take up arms against our oppressors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The cost shall be high for my people, but they are eager to pay it. The cost for remaining slaves would be higher, and it would be paid by our children and our children’s children. If you will help us, we are ready to throw off the yoke of tyranny, even if we lose our lives. Liberty is too precious to sell for the chance of quieter, safer lives under the dark shadow of oppression.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I have allies throughout the city who are ready to raise arms against the Empire at my signal. We are not a warlike people, but the stormtroopers have shown us the basics of violence, and we have learned the lesson well. Against soldiers, I have no doubt that my people would fight bravely with a fair chance at victory. But the Imperial forces have vehicles—large, metal, two-legged machines of war—that we cannot face. My people fear these machines, and though many would still fight bravely, too many would wait to see if we could topple them. Such an attack would be staggered and lose too much of its impact. Only if many of us take up arms at once can we overthrow our oppressors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“But you are outsiders, and to be standing here, you must have opposed the Empire’s machines successfully. Many of my less confident allies believe that with your aid, even the walking war machines could not stop us. This would give them the confidence to bring enough forces to bear at once. If we can take control of the planetary shields and turbolasers that they have nearly finished building on Mount Antas, we can complete those structures ourselves and use them to defend against further Imperial attack. The first step in such an attack is a citywide riot, which I am prepared to trigger.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“But you are outsiders, and to be standing here, you must have opposed the Empire’s machines successfully.

Below are answers to some likely questions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How did the Empire seize control? “They came as friends, claiming that we were in danger of being attacked by Separatists who wished to use our world as a secret base. The Empire landed troops and built barracks. Then, after they had more weapons than we did, they took over the city and the mountain and begin shipping our people off like cattle.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What are you planning to do during the riot? “I have every intention of fighting by your side. I can guide you around the city and ensure that your help goes where it is needed the most. I would not ask you to take any risk that I am unwilling to take myself.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How many Nazren will join you? “Dozens at first, then hundreds, and then, I believe, thousands. Eventually, we might be able to bring the whole world into the fight.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Where does the Empire keep its important records? “They might be in the control center below Martyr’s Plaza. It houses our most advanced computer system, which tracks major rogue fragments in orbit. The Empire currently controls it and thus flies safely in our skies. Another possible location is the construction site on Mount Antas. It is heavily guarded, but if we take the city, the Empire will be forced to move many soldiers into the streets, leaving the site more vulnerable.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How will you prevent the Empire from returning and taking over again? “If we regain control of the tracking station, we can ensure that the Empire’s ships are threatened by space debris and that only our allies can safely fly near our world.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes reject Sartok’s request for help, the resistance leader still gives the signal for his people to riot, thus allowing the adventure to continue. However, the Nazren are brutally suppressed and treated even more harshly by the Imperials.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Note: Rescuing Sartok and finishing the discussion with him before the riots happen should be considered a level up milestone.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SARTOK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid, chaotic light</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (fiber armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 84 (13d8+26)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11 (+0) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 16 (+3) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Deception +5, Perception +6, Persuasion +5, Stealth +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Dosh, Nazren</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 5 (1,800 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

Once he does, however, things start to move very quickly. The riots are a series of several encounters that can occur in any order, with one exception. The “Point Gold” encounter must be the final encounter of the adventure, as it signals the end of the Imperial dominance of Nizon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sartok can lead the heroes through the city to these encounters, or they can find their own way. Regardless, you are free to determine which encounters the heroes must deal with and in what order. Additionally, you can design your own noncombat encounters, particularly challenges that require the use of skills. For these challenges, use the following guidelines: easy task: DC 10, moderate task: DC 15, hard task: DC 20, and challenging task: DC 25.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For example, during the riots, an injured Nazren resistance fighter might become trapped on top of a condemned building, with no way to get down. You might determine that getting to the Nazren would be a hard task (allowing Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to balance on the crumbling stairs or Strength (Athletics) checks to scale the outside of the building) at DC 20. Once the heroes reach the roof, they can provide medical assistance or lower the Nazren safely to the ground.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Below are several skill-based encounters that you can use between combat encounters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Nazren resistance fighter picks up transmissions on an Imperial channel from a guard post that has received word of the riots. The heroes must pose as Imperial officers, making Chasrima (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) checks to convince the guard post not to send reinforcements.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A stash of weapons in an Imperial garrison could be enough to turn the tide in several sections of the city. The heroes try to use Charisma (Deception) to bluff their way into the garrison or Dexterity (Stealth) to sneak in, obtaining the weapons and funneling them to the resistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A communications array atop a Nazren building needs to be disabled so that the Empire cannot signal the Arkanian Dragon for help. The heroes can make Strength (Athletics) checks to reach the roof and then plant explosives. Alternatively, they might make Intelligence (slicer's kit) checks to seize control of the array and use it to coordinate groups of resistance fighters throughout the city.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A group of captured resistance fighters was abandoned in a detention facility when the Imperial guards were called away to reinforce another position. The heroes must make Intelligence (slicers kit) or Strength checks to open the cell doors, allowing the prisoners to escape and join the resistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For months, Nazren slaves have been covertly stowing the parts for an anti-aircraft weapon in secret locations, and now the resistance needs to build the weapon to protect against attacks by V-wing fighters stationed on Nizon. The heroes must help carry the heavy equipment up to the roof of a building, where the weapon must be assembled quickly with Intelligence checks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The chaos of the riots has left many resistance groups scattered and uncoordinated. One group in particular has obtained access codes to the Imperial garrison, but the group cannot be found. The heroes must make Intelligence (Investigation) checks to locate the missing Nazren or find alternative ways to contact them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the riots are well underway, Sartok needs the heroes’ assistance in coordinating the rest of the attacks. They can make Intelligence checks to plan the next attack or make Intelligence checks to notice flaws in Sartok’s plans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CHECKPOINT GAMMA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the ways that the Empire has kept the local population under control is with heavily armed checkpoints throughout the city. Movement is limited to those with the proper Imperial forms, making it difficult for the Nazren to gather and plan. Now, reports come to the heroes that a central checkpoint, Gamma, is being held by AT-RT walkers equipped with heavy weapons. Unless it can be opened up, the small units of Nazren trying to start an uprising won’t be able to get together to form more effective squads of rioters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a wide street, littered with abandoned crates and broken-down speeders. The checkpoint is a gate between two ferrocrete barricades. Behind it, three AT-RT personal walkers fire freely at anyone who does not have clearance to pass through.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text aloud as soon as the insurrection starts. If the heroes have agreed to help the Nazren, they are sought out for aid. Otherwise, they happen to be the first people the wounded Nazren finds while looking for assistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Nazren with serious battle wounds comes stumbling out of the smoke. Upon seeing you, she rushes up, pointing to a rubble-choked street behind her.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Imperials have set up a new checkpoint, with heavy weapons guarding it! We can’t break through, and it’s preventing our two largest groups from connecting and taking control of the outer sections of the city!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through the smoke, you see flashes of heavy blaster fire and hear more Nazren running from a fight that seems to be too much for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AT-RT (3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Because the dust and grit in the air tends to cause fast wear and tear on speeders, the Empire has assigned a dozen old AT-RTs (one-person walkers) left over from the Clone Wars to reinforce ground troops in the city. Three of them are present at this checkpoint. The pilots of the vehicles are veteran clone troopers, in the last years of their service to the Empire. If you need statistics for the pilots, use those the 'Stormtrooper' statblock from the \"Collateral Damage\" encounter further down. However, if an AT-RT is taken down, its pilot most likely is out of the fight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AT-RT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Large construct, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 15 (armor plating)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 58 (9d10+9)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 50 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15 (+2) 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 7 (-1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities Ion</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Necrotic, poison, psychic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities posion, disease</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Dosh, Nazren</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Circuitry.

The construct launches a mortar at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.

If the AT-RT pilots don’t see any heavy weapons, they march out and deal with attackers directly. If an obvious threat (such as a blaster cannon) is present, the pilots stay behind their barrier and fire from cover, using mortars to attack foes in cover or tight groups.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes take out Checkpoint Gamma, Vril Vrakth sends two of his crab droids (see the “Point Gold” encounter) into the chaos as the Nazren link up to take control of various parts of the city. If the heroes don’t destroy the checkpoint (either because they don’t try or because the fight goes badly for them), Vrakth gathers information about their activities from Imperial allies and sends two crab droids into the next encounter the heroes have.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any AT-RTs survive, they show signs of damage. The Nazren offer to haul the walkers to an underground shop to see if they can be repaired. If a hero insists on piloting a walker, he must make a DC 18 Mechanics check between each encounter to keep it running smoothly. Be sure to keep track of its reduced hit points.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The barrier across the roadway is made of ferrocrete (DR 10, 150 hit points per section). It’s 5 feet high and gives half cover to the AT-RTs against any attacks from the far side. The gate is only wire mesh and gives no cover.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The stone buildings to either side are old, and chunks of them can be brought down on a 10 foot square with an attack or explosion. At least one AT-RT pilot tries this with his laser cannon if any heroes stay behind cover, and the option is available for the heroes as well. A creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) kinetic damage on a failed save. A chunk caused by an explosion instead causes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) kinetic damage as the chunk is far larger than one caused by a normal weapon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>COLLATERAL DAMAGE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the Imperial forces begin to react to the rioting, a set of cannons on Mount Antas starts to bombard residential areas. As the heroes run by a building, it takes a hit and begins to collapse. Fire breaks out in the lower floors, and numerous young Nazren are trapped within the structure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This area features two buildings, the collapsing residential building and a small warehouse. 12 Stormtroopers are positioned on the roof of the warehouse. Anyone inside either building has three quarters cover from attacks from the outside, and anyone on the roof of either building has three quarters cover from those not on one of the two roofs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text aloud any time the heroes are moving from one part of the city to another.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The sounds of distant combat echo from every street as the city erupts into widespread violence. The smell of smoke and burned insulation becomes thick enough to reach you even through your filter masks. A loud clap of thunder announces the opening of heavy blaster artillery bombarding the city from the base of Mount Antas. One of the heavy bolts arcs into the city near you, and a wave of debris showers over you as a building takes a direct hit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nazren children inside the building cry for help as the structure leans to the side, and fire bursts out through the lower-floor windows. A few adult Nazren rush toward the building but are forced to take cover as stormtroopers on the roof of a nearby warehouse open fire on them. While the children seem to be moving safely to the top of their ravaged home, the burning building will claim their lives in a matter of minutes if the stormtroopers don’t allow some rescue effort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NAZREN CHILDREN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are a dozen panicked Nazren children trapped on the roof of the burning building. They are Small creatures, unwilling to make attacks and not currently the targets of any enemy fire. Treat them as having an AC of 10 and if their abilities become important, they have no proficiencies and attributes scores of 10.

The squad can take one reaction each turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack.

Each creature of the squad's choice in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) energy damage, or 18 (4d8) energy damage if the squad has half its hit points or fewer. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The stormtroopers are here to call in targeting instructions to the blaster artillery on Mount Antas. They had the residential building hit to ensure that no provocateurs were inside (none were). They have no interest in the trapped children and don’t target them, but the stormtroopers shoot at any hero or armed Nazren. The stormtroopers try to hold their defensible position on the warehouse roof, but they move if forced to (such as if someone throws a gas grenade onto the roof). Otherwise, they shoot first at any hero who doesn’t have cover, and then at any hero who seems heavily armed.

These adult Nazren are grateful to the heroes for their help and offer what minor assistance they can. A single medpac may be available for wounded heroes, or the Nazren can give directions to any other part of the city, including Martyr’s Plaza, the spaceport, or even the artillery if a hero thinks to ask—one of the Nazren here helped dig the moorings for the blaster cannons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a stormtrooper is killed or captured, his utility belt beeps, revealing a coded comlink. A DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check allows a character to activate the commlink and receive communication from the blaster artillery on the lower levels of Mount Antas. The artillery is reporting to all spotters to hold targeting commands until further notice. The old Clone Wars-era artillery has suffered a malfunction and won’t be able to fire for another 15 minutes or so. The commlink is attached to a datapad that shows the artillery’s concealed location. Armed with this information, the heroes may make a strike on the artillery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The collapsing building is 40 feet tall, and all Nazren inside it are currently on the top floor. Moving through the building is hard because it’s badly damaged, and the whole building counts as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The bottom floor is on fire. Each round that the heroes are in it, they must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 fire damage on a failed save and catching fire with a success only taking half damage and not being set on fire. Taking reasonable precautions (such as getting wet or covering up with a thick blanket) grants advantage to the saving throw. A character who is on fire can put themselves out as an action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The entire burning building is also a smoke hazard. Each round that a character is exposed to a smoke hazard, every creature inside needs to hold its breath or begin to suffocate from the smoke inhalation. The smoke hazard is also considered to be heavily obscured.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though the stairs in the burning building still work, they are in the far corner, reachable only by moving through a lot of smoke and fire. The turbolift shaft, which is closer, no longer has a working turbolift, but it can be climbed with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character can also climb up the outside of the building with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Climbing up the outside of the building protects a hero from smoke damage but not from the fire. Climbing while carrying another creature imposes disadvantage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The roof of the burning building is currently free of fire and smoke hazards, but that won’t last long. Every 5 rounds, one randomly selected square of the roof catches fire, and all surrounding squares become smoke hazards. Once there is no longer enough room on the roof for all refugees, they begin to jump. A falling creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed save, the character takes 14 (4d6) points of kinetic damage taking half damage if they pass. (The adult Nazren in the area gather around the building, ignoring stormtrooper fire to catch any children who jump so that the kids don’t take falling damage.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The warehouse is in much better shape. A lip runs around the outer edge, allowing any prone character to gain full cover against attacks made from the ground or the burning building. The outer wall of the warehouse is more difficult to climb than the residential building requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but the building has two working lifts inside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any time a frag grenade or other explosive is set off inside the burning building, everyone in the building is showered with rubble as the damaged structure shudders. Have every creature inside make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (1d10) kinetic damage on a failed save.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REST STOP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes make their way through the city, they find themselves cornered by advancing Imperial artillery. Fortunately, the heroes have earned a reputation in the city by now, and a Nazren woman comes to their aid, leading them to a safehouse to rest. This should give the heroes a chance to recover and heal, though their respite doesn’t last long. Crab droids sent by Vril Vrakth find the safehouse and burrow inside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As starfighter-damaged buildings bury a street, an old Nazren woman leads the heroes to safety. They get a few minutes of respite before some of Vril Vrakth’s crab droids find them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text aloud any time the heroes seem to need a break from nonstop rioting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>V-wings go screaming overhead, dropping mines and making blaster-fire runs on larger buildings. One of the buildings beside you explodes, sending chunks of rubble everywhere. The buildings groan and look ready to collapse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From a set of stairs leading down into a sturdy-looking basement bunker, a voice calls to you. “Over here! Quickly, you’ll be safe here!” A frail, older Nazren female waves you to follow her into the lower level of what seems to be a church or old meeting house. With a loud crack, other buildings begin to slide into the street and threaten to bury you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>YURKA AGGEL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The old Nazren is Yurka Aggel, a healer and wise woman among her kind. She aids the heroes in any way she can, which is mostly limited to her single Force power, Give Life. Aggel has seen her people go from a proud and independent civilization to Imperial slaves, and she is happy to see the Nazren rise up to throw off the Empire’s shackles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aggel wont fight any enemies and wont accompany the heroes but can use the Give Life at-will force power, acting as if she had 8d6 hit dice available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CRAB DROID (3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unless they’ve all been destroyed already (which is unlikely), three of Vril Vrakth’s crab droids crawl in through a tunnel in the back of the shelter and attack the heroes.

The crab droid jet-sprays the contents of its mud tank onto a space within 30 feet, turning that space into difficult terrain, and forcing any creatures standing on it to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This attack cannot be used if the crab droid's mud tank is empty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The crab droids aren’t complicated.

An inspection of the crab droids shows that they have been heavily damaged, repaired, and modified over the years, but not by the Empire. Each droid bears an owner’s stamp. Anyone who knows Zabrak or who makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check can identify the stamp as a Zabrak symbol that is best translated as “long hunter.” This might be the heroes’ first clue that a bounty hunter is on their trail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The walls of this basement are sturdy, as are the pillars holding it up. The crab droids dig their way in across from the entrance and leave a tunnel leading out. The stairs are buried when the buildings outside collapse, so the tunnel becomes the only exit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE BLACK SHIP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the rioting, the heroes see a black cargo vessel fly overhead, trailing smoke from badly tuned engines. The ship has the same markings as the slave transport they saw in The Queen of Air and Darkness, as well as the ship that was being escorted off Nizon by the Arkanian Dragon. The black ship shrugs off light weapons fire from the surface and lands a short distance away. If Sartok is still with the heroes, he informs them that the vessel has landed near the slave pens, where there is still one shipload of Nazren scheduled to be flown offworld and sold into slavery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The black ship is the same type as the one encountered in The Queen of Air and Darkness—a Gallofree Yards Medium Transport. It is staffed by 18 Trandoshan slavers, though only nine of them are free to fight at any given moment. The rest remain inside the ship, struggling to repair the damaged systems so that it can take off again as soon as the latest crop of slaves is aboard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The cliff wall that runs along the north edge of the landing platform is very rough and has numerous cables and sensors bolted to it. This makes it very easy to climb, only requiring a DC 7 Strength (Athletics) check and gives characters the opportunity to take cover if they wish. A cable can be used as an improvised electrostaff but can’t be taken more than 15 feet from the wall without breaking loose and losing power. A DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check allows a wrenched-free cable to incapacitate the black ship, stranding the Trandoshan slavers here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The slavers also have four nashtah, six-legged lizards about the size of a big dog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes approach the site of the slaver ship (named The Bloody Credit), read the following.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The foul scent of acidic vapors chokes the air, and you hear the barks of rushed orders ahead of you. Turning the corner, you see a group of Trandoshans in old military jumpsuits, along with four multilegged lizard beasts, all wearing breath masks and driving a line of Nazren toward the black ship. You’ve seen ships of this type before—they carry slaves. The Trandoshans seem to be in a hurry and aren’t being gentle. They cuff and beat the Nazren, forcing the prisoners along a docking wall covered with cables and into the ship’s loading ramp.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SLAVERS (9)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Trandoshan slavers are experienced mercenaries who fought as Separatist soldiers during the Clone Wars and who have been capturing and moving Wookiees for the Empire. Because they usually want to capture subjects alive and often have to deal with rebellious slaves without damaging them too badly, the slavers have more experience in unarmed combat than with firing blasters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nine Trandoshans remain inside the ship, trying to repair its systems so that it can take off again. Meanwhile, nine more slavers are rounding up Nazren outside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Much of the cargo space in The Bloody Credit has been converted to slave pens. The Trandoshans use all the regular passenger space for themselves, allowing the ship to have a larger-than-normal crew.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each trandoshan has 1,000 credits on them, for a total of 9,000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NASHTAH (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Like the slavers, the nashtah have breath masks strapped on to protect them from the smoke. Choose one of the slavers to be the nashtah handler. If that slaver is taken out, the nashtah flee the scene if they are intimidated, move more than 1 step down the condition track, or suffer any fear effect. Otherwise, the beasts attack the closest hero at the beginning of each round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Trandoshans want to escape with enough slaves to turn a profit. If that doesn’t seem likely, however, they run for it. If they can get all their forces into the ship, it takes off with whatever slaves are already inside. If the heroes gain control of the ship, the remaining slavers run into the city and try to hide from the Nazren’s wrath.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TRANDOSHAN SLAVER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Trandoshan), chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (natural armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 69 (7d8+7)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16 (+3) 13 (+1) 13 (+1) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 9 (-1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +5, Wis +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +5, Perception +3, Survival +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Dosh</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Infared Vision.

If they dare, they can take to their starship and go after it. If they take this approach, run a space battle at the edge of the planet’s ring of dust and debris, using the same rules as in Part 2: Into the Jaws. If the combat lasts more than 10 rounds, three V-wings arrive to aid the slave ship. Three additional V-wings arrive on round 15, and the Arkanian Dragon shows up on round 20. (If the heroes managed to defeat the Dragon earlier in the adventure, use another Victory II Star Destroyer with the same stats instead.) However, if at any time the slaver ship has fewer than half its hit points and no Imperial ship is present to assist it, the Trandoshans surrender and either land or allow the heroes to board their ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any freed slaves immediately grab weapons from the slavers (or use tools or sticks to arm themselves if nothing else is handy) and rush off to join the revolt. (They don’t attack the Trandoshans, leaving that to the heroes, which prevents you from having to run too many GM characters in this conflict.) This escalates the rioting within the city to its peak and draws Imperial forces away from Martyr’s Plaza. If the heroes fail to free any slaves (and thus don’t draw forces away from the plaza), add an AT-RT (from the “Checkpoint Gamma” encounter) to the “Battle for Martyr’s Plaza” encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If there are any crab droids left in Vrakth’s arsenal, they attack the heroes at the landing pad 5 minutes after the slaver encounter ends. They fight until one crab droid is destroyed, at which point the remaining droids flee in different directions to rendezvous with Vrakth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The entire area is filled with smoke; the badly tuned engines of the slavers’ ship belch gas and impurities into the air. The slavers had planned to get the engines fixed before taking off, but the rioting has convinced them otherwise. The smoke acts as an atmospheric hazard, forcing all creatures not wearing breath masks (as all the slavers and nashtah are) to make a Constitution saving throw at the end of their turn. A failed save causes the creature to take 9 (2d8) points of poison damage gives the creature a level of exhaustion. Crude efforts to block the smoke (such as tying a wet cloth across the mouth) don’t prevent the damage but do stop the creature from gaining a level of exhaustion. All of the Nazren slaves are protected in this manner, but each slave would gladly give his or her protection to a hero in trouble. The smoke also gives everyone in the area concealment if they are not adjacent to their attacker.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nine Trandoshans in the ship are too busy to fight anyone who gets inside; the ship is in bad shape and needs care or it won’t take off. Any hero inside the ship can free five Nazren slaves each round. There are 60 slaves inside the ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MARTYR'S PLAZA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the riots spread through the city, more and more Imperial forces leave their posts to reinforce troops in trouble elsewhere. Eventually, up to half the forces in each security zone have moved off, leaving those locations as vulnerable as they’ll ever be. In particular, the forces in Martyr’s Plaza have sent away one of their two AT-STs and several dozen troopers, leaving it less well guarded than at any time during the Imperial occupation. At the center of the plaza is the access to the underground control center, which directs all communications on Nizon and monitors the asteroid fragments that endanger nearby starships. As long as Imperial forces hold the control center, their vessels can fly freely through space around Nizon and land troops wherever they wish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When word comes of the reduced security at the entrance to the control center, Sartok tells the heroes (either face to face or via commlink) to move to Martyr’s Plaza and secure the entrance. If the heroes do so, they will allow the Nazren to take control of the center, which will enable them to keep the Empire off their world indefinitely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the center of Martyr’s Plaza is a 30-feet wide stone dome with a hatch on top. Three massive statues surround it, depicting ancient martyred heroes of the Nazren. The Empire has set up three defensive turrets between the statues. An AT-ST patrols the 30-meter-wide empty circle around the dome and statues. If there are any other forces here, they support the AT-ST.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The AT-ST is a major foe for the heroes, and this battle is one of the centerpieces of the adventure. The heroes might be able to defeat the walker through sheer firepower, but they can also attempt to take control of a turret or topple a giant statue onto the AT-ST. If the heroes come up with another workable plan for dealing with the walker, feel free to run with it. Beating the machine that has terrified the Nazren for months should be the heroes’ greatest moment of glory to date.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following text as soon as the heroes can see the plaza.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Martyr’s Plaza is a picture of dichotomy. The ornate central stone dome is covered in scrollwork and decorative bas reliefs of Nazren history. A hatch sits atop the dome, its thick metal etched with golden colors. Standing around the dome are three 50 feet-tall statues. Each depicts a Nazren in robes, arms extended and face tilted up to the sky. Though the statues are noble and moving, they are also centuries old. Each shows signs of wear from the elements, and their bases are cracked and worn away. One of the statues leans slightly, and the others don’t seem securely set in their mountings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Marring this peaceful and holy place are the ugly scars of Imperial occupation. Three armored turrets sit between the statues, blasters tracking the outer rim of the plaza. Walking in patrol around the dome is an All-Terrain Scout Transport, a massive war machine armed with twin blaster cannons and a grenade launcher. The walker seems undamaged and is alert for possible trouble.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each turret is located between two of the three statues. As a result, each one has line of sight to only a third of the battlefield, and the turrets cannot target each other. They are currently inactive however and thus will not target the players as they lack gunners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish to increase the difficulty of the encounter, feel free to place enemies inside the turrets but be careful that you don't push the encounter too hard on the players, Vril Vrakth is still out there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the pilot of the AT-ST becomes relevant, use the 'Trooper, Scout' statblock from Scum and Villainy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>AT-ST</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Huge construct, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (armor plating)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 283 (25d12+100)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 20 (+5) 19 (+4) 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 9 (-1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +9, Con +9</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities ion</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances necrotic, poison, psychic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities disease, exhaustion, poisoned, unconscious</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 14 (11,500 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Circuitry.

Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 300/900 ft., one target that must be at least 60 ft away from the turret. Hit 16 (4d6+2) energy damage. Additionally, hit or miss, the target and each creature within 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15), taking 14 (4d6) energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The AT-ST is aggressive, hunting down any heroes it spots and attacking with a full weapon load. If a hero has cover, the walker isn’t shy about using its grenade launcher to attack an area or firing all weapons at the cover in attempt to destroy it. The walker tries to ensure that no one swarms over and takes control of a turret as it could be a major threat to it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the AT-ST, they can open the hatch in the stone dome and descend into the underground control center. The six Imperial technicians inside the station surrender. They realize that they have no chance against any force able to defeat a walker. On the other hand, if you want to run another encounter in the control center, have the Imperial technicians resist the intruders, use the 'Stormtrooper' statblock from 'Collateral Damage' for these technicians.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes and their Nazren allies take over the control center, they are in charge of all communication on the planet. They can cut off Imperial communications planetwide, and they begin to hear reports of Nazren defeating stormtroopers throughout the city.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition, the Nazren now control the rogue tracking station. The Empire will have to deal with rogue fragments if they wish to land on Nizon from space, greatly increasing the difficulty of an Imperial mission to retake the planet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The control center is also able to track the crab droids that have been harassing the heroes by tracing their signal back to its origin. If a hero thinks to try this, it requires a DC 16 Intelligence (Technology) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes also detect a message from an Imperial officer to Vril Vrakth, who is stationed on Mount Antas. It instructs him to wait for any remaining officers within the city, then destroy the Sarlacc Project database and evacuate the planet. Vrakth acknowledges the order but doesn’t promise to obey it. If the heroes contact Vrakth, he offers to leave the database intact but taunts them by suggesting that they come talk to him about it in person. Vrakth isn’t done with his hunt just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Sartok accompanied the heroes into the control center, he asks to remain there so that he can coordinate revolts planetwide. However, if the heroes want him to keep traveling with them, he agrees to do so, assigning another Nazren to stay and begin the worldwide operations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The three central statues of the martyrs are sitting loose on their bases, and each weighs as much as a space transport. However, a judicious use of explosives might be able to knock one over, possibly crushing a turret or even the AT-ST. A single breaching charge, four or more grenades, rockets or other simialr explosives. Also, any attack at the base of a statue that hits an AC of 25 and does more than 15 damage can knock over the statue. If attack does not hit the AC of the statue, it does not miss but rather damages the statue itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a statue is knocked over, it covers an area 15 feet wide and 50 feet long, starting from its base. Whoever knocked it over decides exactly what area it covers and any creature caught inside the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d10 kinetic damage on a failed save. In addition if a creature fails this save they are pinned by the rubble and are affected by the restrained and prone conditions. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself from the rubble. Anyone unable to free themselves can be dug out by a dozen or so workers in 10 to 20 minutes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hatch on the dome, which leads to the underground control center, has an AC of 18 and 150 hit points. It can be bypassed with a DC 25 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>POINT GOLD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Capturing the control center is the endgame of Sartok’s plans to take back the planet, and once that has been accomplished, the Nazren believe that victory and freedom are inevitable. The Empire, however, has no faith in something as simple as asteroid fragments or a tracking station to secure a whole world. They have begun construction of a planetary turbolaser battery on Mount Antas outside the city, along with a shield generator large enough to cover the turbolasers and the city itself. While only one battery is currently operational, it has the firepower to challenge even a Star Destroyer and could be used to clear a section of space of rogue asteroid fragments, allowing troop ships to land. As long as the mountain base is in Imperial hands, more forces could return to retake the planet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This base, Point Gold, is currently manned mostly by neutral technicians and minor Imperial officers. While Imperial doctrine calls for it to have an AT-AT and a division of troops, they have not arrived yet. All ground forces from the Arkanian Dragon were deployed throughout the city, and if the heroes have taken out the AT-ST already, they’ve dealt with the largest part of the ground forces.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, Vril Vrakth has been using Point Gold as a base of operations for his attempts to target Sartok and the heroes. His ship is docked on a small landing bay at the edge of a construction platform, guarded by however many crab droids remain. With the whole planet in open revolt, Vrakth has been waiting for an opportunity to capture the heroes, assuming that they are behind the riots. The Zabrak bounty hunter has pulled the datachip for the Sarlacc Project, since he knows that the Imperials want it destroyed, and placed it in the center of the 160 foot-square construction platform, which is 200 feet up in the partially finished shield generator. He wants to be high up so that he can see the heroes coming. Vrakth believes that he can defeat them, turn the tide on the revolt, and collect a huge bounty from the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter follows immediately after the heroes seize the entrance to the control center beneath Martyr’s Plaza. It takes place atop a shield generator on Mount Antas, which was under construction when the riots began.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in this area, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The massive shield generator is incomplete but is already the biggest structure in or near the city. While the eastern third is finished, the rest is a mass of unfinished framework and construction platforms. The far western section of the frame has a platform many feet in the air, with a cloakshape fighter docked next to it. A Zabrak male in battle armor stands at the edge of the platform and beckons to you. He holds a datachip in his hand and touches his throat. His voice booms out over the distance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Is this what you’ve caused all this difficulty over? Is this why a request was made to Aldera University about this dustball? Well, then, come and get it from me. Inquisitor Draco will pay me well for bringing him your battered bodies in manacles!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VRIL VRAKTH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vril Vrakth was raised on a failed colony, a world too harsh to support much life. As food and resources became increasingly scarce, his people turned on themselves in a series of increasingly vicious settlement wars. Though Vrakth originally began training as a soldier, he changed to follow the career of a scout. He learned the value of hunting prey with caution, but he also learned that most battles are won by those who shoot the fastest and can withstand the most damage. When a bounty hunter named Jeyrs Hundar followed a criminal to Vrakth’s homeland, the young Zabrak was one of only a handful of colonists still alive. Impressed with Vrakth’s tenacity and self-reliance, Hundar took him on as an apprentice bounty hunter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vrakth alternated between training to be a warrior and training to be a hunter, eventually becoming a crack shot with a pistol. He served as Hundar’s backup, covering escape routes and double-teaming the targets that were too dangerous to take solo. When Hundar proved too slow to bring in a particularly vicious Rodian, Vrakth completed the job. This established him as a feared bounty hunter. He soon came to the attention of a local Republic governor, who used him to hunt down CIS generals during the Clone Wars. Vrakth now works almost exclusively for the Empire, especially Inquisitor Valin Draco.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VRIL VRAKTH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Zabrak), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (weave armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 83 (15d8+15)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16 (+3) 18 (+4) 13 (+1) 19 (+4) 12 (+1) 11 (0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +6, Wis +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +5, Intimidation +2, Perception +3, Survival +3, Technology +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Zabrak</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tech Casting.

The droids have been hunting and harassing the heroes throughout their time on Nizon, and if any remain, they are here. Since Vrakth is not directly controlling the crab droids, they attack the nearest foe who attacks Vrakth.

The crab droid jet-sprays the contents of its mud tank onto a space within 30 feet, turning that space into difficult terrain, and forcing any creatures standing on it to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This attack cannot be used if the crab droid's mud tank is empty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the encounter has concluded, the heroes and their Nazren allies control the city, the rogue fragment tracking center, and the construction on Mount Antas. Any remaining Imperial forces evacuate or surrender, and reports begin to come in of Nazren seizing control in smaller outposts and settlements. Between the tracking center and the planetary shields and turbolasers (which they can complete), the Nazren can make retaking their planet too costly for the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vrakth remains in contact with his apprentice, a Trandoshan bounty hunter named Koorst, who is flying in a cloakshape fighter with a hyperspace sled outside the range of the planet’s asteroid fragments and dust clouds. Koorst can’t fly safely to the surface now that the tracking station is in Nazren hands, but he receives constant reports from Vrakth during the rioting and even the final battle. If Vrakth is taken down, he drops an open commlink (unblocked by the Nazren in the control center) that shows Koorst yelling for more information. If the heroes pick up the commlink and Koorst sees any of their faces, he swears his eternal hatred of those who felled his mentor, then flies off into hyperspace. He will return in The Gem of Alderaan, later in the Dawn of Defiance campaign.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vril Vrakth has a cloakshape fighter with an open cockpit docked on the southern edge of a construction platform. The fighter is datalocked and cannot be used in the battle; even a dedicated slicer would need too much time to crack it. However, in the cockpit is the control system with which Vrakth gives override orders to the crab droids. With a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check, a player could send an override command as an action, controlling a droid’s turn or resetting which targets it considers hostile, thus allowing it to make its own decisions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is a framework all around the construction platform, which requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to move around in. The framework extends above the platform, starting 20 feet higher, so characters can jump up to it or climb to a higher vantage point (and potentially jump down). However, the area is quite open, and there’s very little cover to allow a Stealth check unless Vrakth is distracted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One square of the platform has a loose plate that a character might fall through. Vrakth arranged this as a simple trap if he’s rushed; he and the crab droids avoid that square. Any hero stepping on it must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall at least 30 feet and take 3d6 points of falling damage. In addition, anyone who falls through must make the DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to get back up to the platform.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though Vrakth did not destroy the Sarlacc Project datachip, he still damaged it. It takes time and a DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check to get anything out of the cracked, burned chip. If the heroes can’t manage that task, they have allies who can. Eventually, they discover that the Sarlacc Project is a massive construction effort taking place in the Deep Core, with costs so high that the Empire decided to complete it with slave labor. The information on the datachip does not specify any details about what, exactly, is being built. But all contacts and notes are tied directly to Coruscant, which seems to be the place to go for more information on the project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are now honored allies of Nizon, treated with respect by any Nazren they encounter. Sartok begins to work toward a planetary council, though he confesses to the heroes that he hopes he isn’t on it— he’d prefer to leave his leadership role behind. He does, however, ask the heroes to take a message of friendship to Senator Organa, along with an offer that the Nazren will help him against the Empire in the future. This victory is minor in the grand scheme of things, but it’s an important beginning, proving that the Empire can be defeated, at least on small planets outside the Core Worlds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any heroes were killed during the adventure, the grateful Nazren erect a statue in their honor in Martyr’s Plaza.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the Empire’s part, losing the Nazren as a source of slave labor is irritating, but thanks to the tracking station, they have little choice but to stay clear of the planet—at least temporarily. The Empire is too new to spend many resources dealing with the Nazren, and work on the Sarlacc Project can continue with Wookiee and Mon Calamari slaves. Believing that all information on the project has been destroyed, the Imperials abandon the world for the time being.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WWW.GMBINDER.COM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This document was lovingly created using GM Binder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you would like to support the GM Binder developers, consider joining our Patreon community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GM Binder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Discover</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Log In</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Register</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Further Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terms of Service</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Us</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>   </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"oEqRU3jP6TbV0hNn","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"IzRPQKyF46Doyn4B","name":"A Visit from Six-Six","content":"<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">A Visit from Six-Six</h2>\n<p>One member of <strong>Darga’s court</strong> that the heroes have interacted with but might not have thought much about is the translating protocol droid, <strong>TC-663</strong>. Unremarkable during the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> thus far, <strong>TC-663</strong> is occasionally seen wandering the halls of the <strong>palace </strong>on one errand or another. At some point when the heroes are all together away from the Hutt’s court, the shiny silver droid approaches them and asks to speak with them in private.</p>\n<p>When he is certain they are alone,<strong> TC-663</strong> (who insists that the heroes call him <strong>Six-Six</strong>) explains that in addition to serving as the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> translator, he also serves another master—a droid crime lord named <strong>Switch,</strong> who lives on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> above the world of <strong>Brentaal.</strong> If the heroes played through <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, they have probably already encountered <strong>Switch</strong> and perhaps even offered to act as his agents in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six</strong> reveals that he has come to convey a small piece of information on <strong>Switch’s</strong> behalf. The droid tells the heroes that he has been monitoring communications leaving <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, and it seems that someone has been transmitting information to the Empire while the <strong>Hutt</strong> sleeps, receiving instructions in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six </strong>has been sending these messages on to <strong>Switch,</strong> but the droid crime lord has been unable to break their encryption. <strong>Switch</strong> has ordered<strong> Six-Six</strong> to turn the encrypted transmissions file over to the heroes and see what they can make of it. If the heroes are willing to share their findings with <strong>Six-Six</strong> (who will share them with <strong>Switch),</strong> they can have the file at no charge.</p>\n<p>Any hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> decrypts the file and retrieves the contents of the message. It reveals that late at night, the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> majordomo, <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, has been contacting an Imperial communications relay somewhere in the sector. The heroes cannot be certain who he is communicating with, but they know that <strong>Demos</strong> has been transmitting information about <strong>Darga’s </strong>dealings—particularly his slave trading—on a regular basis. The most recent communication specifically mentions that the slavers that <strong>Darga </strong>has been dealing with are unhappy with their merchandise. Additionally, several messages mention “<strong>the prisoner</strong>” but provide no further details.</p>\n<p>If confronted about his communications with the Empire, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> staunchly denies it. Presenting the decrypted file does not help because <strong>Demos </strong>claims that it must be a forgery, and <strong>Darga </strong>is inclined to agree with his trusted advisor. If the heroes remain adamant that the majordomo is doing something untoward even after <strong>Darga </strong>dismissed this claim, the <strong>Hutt</strong> might become upset. To represent his shifting attitudes, you might wish to treat a previous incident in which the heroes successfully curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor as a failure instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/sixsix_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"573\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YcEBkSk41K8jcfDK]{07 - Handout 7 - Six-Six}</p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":-12500,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"JJ2AhBRa4mQ5kM8y","name":"Part 1: Prelude to Defiance","content":"<h1>Part 1: Prelude to Defiance</h1>\n<p>The <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign opens on an unsuspecting space station orbiting the <strong>Core World</strong> of <strong>Brentaal</strong>. <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> is little more than a travel and cargo port, just like dozens of others in orbit around the world. However, the station is also home not only to the Empire and its lackeys among the nobility of <strong>Brentaal</strong>, but also to the beginnings of the first major resistance group — that of your heroes. In part 1 of <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, the heroes arrive on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> to find that enemies of the Empire have been struggling to gather a valuable piece of cargo and make their way to <strong>Alderaan</strong>. When the heroes become embroiled in the plot, they find that they are rescuing an undercover agent <strong>frozen in carbonite</strong> who has valuable information for <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Senator Bail Organa}.</strong> After some run-ins with local information brokers and Imperial agents, the heroes leave <strong>Brentaal</strong> and head for the scenic planet of <strong>Alderaan</strong>.</p>\n<p>Before the adventure opens, you (the GM) should determine whether the heroes already know one another or whether they are on<strong> Sel Zonn Station</strong> by chance. If the heroes already know one another, they have simply come to the station for the same reason as many other travelers—to rest, relax, refuel, and prepare for the next leg of their journey. If the heroes do not know one another before the adventure begins, discuss in advance what has brought each hero to <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. They might be criminals escaping justice on <strong>Brentaal</strong>, fugitive Jedi on the run from the Empire, legitimate traders or business people passing through, or nobles who have traveled to <strong>Brentaal </strong>to investigate their financial interests.</p>\n<h2>Sell Zonn Station</h2>\n<p><strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> is one of over a dozen XQ2 Space Platforms in orbit around <strong>Brentaal</strong>. Manufactured by <strong>Bengel Shipbuilders</strong> some years before the beginning of the adventure, <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> has not flourished since the rise of the Empire. Though it still sees a great deal of traffic from <strong>Brentaal </strong>and from travelers, the Empire has allowed large sections of the station to languish and fall apart. Thanks to the rise of anti-alien sentiment, especially on the <strong>Core Worlds</strong>, the more run-down sections of <strong>Sel Zonn Station </strong>are now inhabited by aliens. As such, a rift divides the station—wealthy, privileged Human Imperial loyalists occupy the nicer sections of the station, while all others are relegated to worn and sometimes dangerous secondary sections.</p>\n<p>If the heroes arrive at <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> together aboard the same ship, read the following boxed text aloud.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>Seemingly motionless among a sea of starships and satellites above the twinkling world of Brentaal, Sel Zonn Station grows larger in your view every second.

Since <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> orbits a<strong> Core World</strong>, it is far better maintained than other structures of its age, and the main areas see constant renovations and repairs. However, a few steps off of the beaten path quickly reveal that the station is rotting from the inside out. A short walk away from the main venues leads to decrepit sections of the station, filled with broken lights, tarnished metal walls, missing deck plates, and all manner of suspicious aliens that have been driven out of the nicer sections by the Empire.</p>\n<p>Aboard <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>, all doors and walls are made of metal and conform to the standard statistics for objects. Slicing the station’s central computer system has a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>27</strong> and the computer will <strong>trace any failed slicing attempt</strong> to the terminal from which it was made. The station’s information terminals can be found at regular intervals throughout public areas and in private rooms. These terminals can provide basic information on the layout and facilities of the station, but not much else. Each terminal is connected to the central computer system.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing boarding and supply services, <strong>Sel Zonn Station </strong>is host to a number of businesses that cater specifically to travelers. All shopkeepers on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> sell at the prices listed in the <em><strong>Player's Handbook</strong></em>. Almost all shops are located on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, though a few are off the beaten path. Some of the most popular establishments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gundark’s Cantina:</strong> Owned and operated by a gruff Human male named <strong>“Gundark” Saff</strong>, <strong>Gundark’s Cantina </strong>is a place where people from all walks of life can come to relax. Though <strong>Gundark </strong>himself shows some anti-alien bias, he does not prevent non-Humans from patronizing his establishment. As such, it is a popular meeting place for nearly anyone on the station, and it features a large number of secluded booths for private conversations.</li>\n<li><strong>The Credit Chip:</strong> A local casino that attracts a wide variety of patrons, the <strong>Credit Chip </strong>is operated by a quiet and brooding Human named <strong>Cecil Vane</strong>. <strong>Vane </strong>doesn’t like what the Empire has done to the station, especially since they don’t take it too well when he cheats Imperial officers out of their money. The most popular games in the galaxy, including <strong>sabacc </strong>and <strong>pazaak</strong>, see a lot of play here.</li>\n<li><strong>Delgas Medical Supplies</strong>: A corporate medical practice and pharmaceutical supplier, <strong>Delgas Medical Supplies</strong> provides care to those who can afford it. The chief doctor in the practice is <strong>Byra Fenn</strong>, a talented Human woman with secrets to keep. <strong>Dr. Fenn</strong> has had extensive dealings with one of thestation’s information brokers, a protocol droid named <strong>@Actor[ZdBVinS88aV4I5c2]{Switch}</strong>, and she owes him several favors.</li>\n<li><strong>Mechanical Allies: </strong>A droid repair and sales shop, this is one of the few businesses run by a non-Human that hasn’t been hut down by the Empire. Operated by an untrustworthy Twi’lek named <strong>San</strong>, <strong>Mechanical Allies</strong> sells all manner of droid parts and reconditioned droids. Despite the fact that most of his droids are faulty, <strong>San </strong>has remained in business thanks to his own savvy and his ability to buy off the Empire from time to time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two primary sources of law enforcement aboard <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. The Empire has a moderate presence, with a garrison aboard to keep the peace and enforce Imperial law. In addition to <strong>stormtroopers </strong>and <strong>Imperial officers</strong>, <strong>Brentaal’s</strong> <strong>planetary security force</strong> keeps a watchful eye on everything that happens on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. The planetary security force gets along well enough with the Empire, though questions of jurisdiction have caused tension between the two in the past. For the most part, the planetary security force operates out of the local security office, where it keeps a number of cells open for criminals and malcontents. Those captured by the Empire, however, are incarcerated in the security office briefly before being transported via shuttle to the planet’s surface. Customs enforcement is relatively light simply because large cargo haulers cannot dock with the station. As such, usually only a single customs officer is on hand for any cargo inspection.</p>\n<p>The main commercial area of<strong> Sel Zonn Station</strong> is known as the <strong>Promenade</strong>. Filled with shops of all kinds, as well as large, open seating areas with fountains, plants, and other decorations, the <strong>Promenade </strong>is where <strong>Brentaal’s </strong>nobles and other station visitors go to enjoy themselves. Security is tight on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, and Imperial forces are on hand at all times to keep the peace. Additionally, the Empire tries to keep the area free of aliens, and as such they harass any non-Humans moving about the <strong>Promenade</strong>. Although they won’t go so far as to arrest anyone, they often try to start fights with aliens just to have an excuse to lock them up. For this reason, most non-Humans tend to stay clear of the <strong>Promenade</strong>, except on rare occasions.</p>\n<h2>First Contact</h2>\n<p>When <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit </strong></em>opens, the heroes are congregating (either together or by chance) in the <strong>Promenade</strong>, where their destinies await them. It is a typical day on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, with a slightly sparser crowd than usual. When the heroes arrive, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>The Promenade is filled with the bustle of revelry and commerce. Spilling out of the gambling halls are the sounds of victory and the moans of defeat, while the music of local bands issues from the cantinas. Only a handful of citizens mill about in the main areas of the Promenade, a few gazing out the massive windows at the planet Brentaal hovering below. Businesspeople hawk their wares to the passersby, and a few security officers make their way down the main avenue of the Promenade on their usual patrol at a leisurely pace.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After the heroes have had a moment to soak in the sights and sounds of the <strong>Promenade</strong>, give them each a chance to make a <strong>DC 10 Perception check</strong>. Those who succeed on the roll notice two men loitering on the <strong>Promenade </strong>who do not appear to be part of the larger crowd. Each seems to be scanning the crowd closely as though looking for someone, though they pay no attention to the heroes. Those who succeed on the <strong>Perception</strong> check with a roll of <strong>15 or higher</strong> also notice that, despite wearing normal traveling clothes, each man is carrying a hold-out blaster tucked into his jacket, and both men are wearing identical garments. Those who succeed on the check with a <strong>20 or higher</strong> also notice that both men seem to be whispering to themselves, obviously speaking into hidden comlinks.</p>\n<p>Within moments, a slender woman wearing the greasy clothes of a mechanic stumbles down the <strong>Promenade</strong>. Though she is trying to hide it, she has clearly been wounded somehow, and she looks disheveled. Once the heroes have had a chance to see the woman, the two men make their way toward her, and she turns and runs toward the nearest hero (or toward the heroes who are closest to one another). She pleads for assistance, offering credits to anyone who will help her. The two men give chase, and the first encounter begins.</p>\n<p>The woman is <strong>@Actor[PKG5ljbdBqdilzmz]{Maya}</strong>, an <strong>Alderaanian </strong>Security agent, and the men are undercover informants for the Empire.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Promenade Shootout - CR 1</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[NZtcLz9CyaHxic9s]{1-01 Promenade Shootout}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Once the heroes subdue the Imperial informers and defeat the security officers, they must quickly get to safety before reinforcements arrive. If the heroes did not manage to save <strong>Maya</strong>, a datapad she carries contains notes on “<strong><em>V14</em></strong>” and “<em><strong>Switch</strong></em>” as clues to the location of some valuable cargo. The heroes should be able to make <strong>Investigation checks</strong> to learn what those words mean. A successful <strong>DC 10 check</strong> reveals that <strong>V14</strong> is a deep storage bay on the station. A successful <strong>DC 15 check</strong> reveals that information, plus the fact that <strong>Switch </strong>is a well-known droid information broker that operates from a secret location within the station. The heroes should be able to figure out that something important (and possibly profitable) is going on, and they should be on the right track to discover <strong>V14’s secrets</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes keep <strong>Maya </strong>from being killed in the fracas, she directs them to safe quarters where they can talk. She is still grievously wounded and has <strong>four levels of exhaustion</strong> that can be removed only with surgery or a dip in a<strong> bacta tank</strong>. However, despite her injuries, she tells the heroes enough to set them on the right path. They need to get to <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong>, where a droid named <strong>Switch </strong>can provide them with the location of some very valuable cargo. According to <strong>Maya</strong>, <strong>Switch</strong> was responsible for receiving and storing this cargo, which was shipped all the way from the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. <strong>Maya </strong>was supposed to contact <strong>Switch</strong>, recover the cargo, and deliver it to <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Senator Bail Organa}</strong><strong> </strong>of <strong>Alderaan</strong>. She reveals that she is a member of <strong>Alderaanian Security</strong> and part of <strong>Organa’s </strong>personal security detail, and that she was waylaid by the Empire mere hours after arriving on the station. Apparently, the fact that she works for a vocal opponent of the Emperor has flagged her as a troublemaker, and the Empire wants her off the station one way or the other.</p>\n<p>If the heroes agree to help her further, <strong>Maya </strong>assures them that <strong>Bail Organa</strong> will be happy to reward them for their efforts, and she emphasizes that the work they are helping her with could save the lives of many innocent beings. She doesn’t go into more detail than that, but she assures the heroes that her mission advances the cause of good. If the heroes can procure the cargo from <strong>Switch</strong>, she will provide them with transport from<strong> Sel Zonn Station </strong>to <strong>Alderaan</strong>. Unfortunately, due to the recent confrontation, the heroes will need to keep a low profile, and <strong>Maya </strong>herself must remain safe in her quarters until fully healed.</p>\n<p>If the heroes take her up on her offer, <strong>Maya</strong> entrusts them with directions to bay <strong>V14</strong> and tells them to contact her when they procure the cargo.</p>\n<h2>Deep Storage Bay V14</h2>\n<p>If the heroes want to learn more about the <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong>, they can do so in a variety of ways. Any informational computer terminal on the station can confirm that bay <strong>V14</strong> is on a level that is off limits to non-Imperial personnel. If the heroes attempt to access further information on <strong>V14 </strong>it can be obtained with the <strong>Technology skill</strong> at a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>15</strong>. A successful <strong>check </strong>reveals that bay <strong>V14</strong> is in a section of the station that has been quarantined for over a year and a half, yet no maintenance requests have been made for repairs to that section. Additionally, the terminal reveals that <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong> is located along one of the station’s primary exhaust systems, meaning that exhaust conduits should be running right through the storage bay.</p>\n<p>An <strong>Investigation check </strong>regarding storage bay <strong>V14</strong> has a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>10 </strong>and counts as learning local news or rumors. Success reveals that despite the fact that <strong>V14 </strong>is in a quarantined zone, a large number of aliens are often seen going into that zone. Rumor has it that the aliens operate some kind of criminal organization out of that section of the station, and that a contingent of Gamorreans is always on guard near the deep storage bay.</p>\n<p>An attempt to learn secret information about bay <strong>V14 </strong>has a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>20 </strong>and reveals that since the quarantine was put into place, the station manager has been taking bribes to keep it that way. The bribes are delivered to the manager on a monthly basis by an <strong>unsavory-looking Twi’lek</strong>, and though the Empire doesn’t like it, the local security forces ensure that Imperials never get too close to the quarantined areas.</p>\n<p>When the heroes finally arrive in the vicinity of <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong>, they find that they have entered a very neglected part of the station. Many of the lights have burned out, and blaster marks and carbon scoring mar the walls, ceiling, and floor. The area reeks of ozone and electrical fires, and pools of coolant litter the hallways at regular intervals. After winding their way through a near-labyrinth of decrepit corridors, the heroes come upon bay <strong>V14</strong>, which is guarded by a pair of <strong>Gamorreans </strong>wielding vibro-axes. (Use the generic <strong>@Actor[QoleTei4axaIwqJC]{Thug}</strong> statistics on page 44 of the <em><strong>SW5e Monster Manual </strong></em>for the <strong>Gamorreans</strong>.)</p>\n<p>If the heroes approach openly, the <strong>Gamorreans </strong>take no hostile actions and seem concerned only with blocking the doors. If the heroes approach stealthily, the <strong>Gamorreans </strong>are not likely to notice and seem more interested in conversing in their grunting language than in watching for outsiders.</p>\n<p>If the heroes attempt to persuade the guards to let them in to see <strong>Switch</strong>, they might find it easier than they suspect. Provided that the heroes do not attack them on sight, if the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 11 Persuasion check</strong>, the guards let them inside. A bribe of at least <strong>50 credits</strong> grants the heroes a <strong>+5 circumstance bonus</strong> on any <strong>Persuasion checks</strong> against the guards.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter bay <strong>V14</strong>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>The deep storage bay is as run-down as the hallways leading up to it, with entire metal plates missing from the floor and a huge, open exhaust shaft near the back of the room. Large crates litter the area, creating the appearance of a haphazard mess, and the air has a distinct smell of sweat and fumes that makes the entire area unpleasant. Flickering lights provide modest illumination, and a burst pipe along the ceiling leaks blue fluid down one wall.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>Near the center of the room is an item that seems very out of place — a large, finely crafted desk made of Japor ivory wood, which means that the desk is both priceless and rare. Sitting peacefully behind the desk is a protocol droid with shiny, ebony coverings that seem to soak up light and offer only the slightest reflection. The droid’s eyes flicker slightly, as though imitating a person blinking rapidly.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At first glance, <strong>Switch</strong>, the protocol droid information broker, appears to be the only occupant of the storage bay, but several of his thugs and associates are also spread throughout the room. Three <strong>@Actor[QoleTei4axaIwqJC]{Bodyguards} </strong>hide behind crates scattered around the room, and the heroes can make <strong>Perception checks</strong> (opposed by the<strong> thugs’ Stealth checks</strong>) to notice them. Additionally, <strong>Switch’s </strong>most valued companion - a blue-and-red astromech droid with the designation <strong>R5-B8</strong> - beeps and burbles quietly beside the protocol droid, seemingly lost in its own world. Lastly, <strong>Switch’s </strong>majordomo, a <strong>@Actor[QoleTei4axaIwqJC]{Twi'lek Thug}</strong>, stands quietly off to one side, not actively hiding but also not clearly visible until the heroes approach the desk.</p>\n<h3>Meeting with Switch</h3>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[ZdBVinS88aV4I5c2]{Switch}</span></strong> is a curious protocol droid that has clearly gone a long time since his last memory wipe. A self-fashioned information broker and budding crime lord, <strong>Switch </strong>has aspirations to sophistication that are likely remnants of his protocol droid programming. With a male personality and a Coruscanti-Imperial accent, <strong>Switch </strong>could fit in among <strong>Brentaal’s </strong>nobility if he were not a droid. When he speaks, he does so cheerfully and lightly, as though his power and prestige leaves him without a care in the world. It is unclear how a protocol droid managed to convince a number of living beings that he should be their leader, but the fact that the thugs follow <strong>Switch</strong> loyally is a testament to his persuasive skills and his acumen as a crime lord.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in bay <strong>V14</strong>, <strong>Switch</strong> greets them warmly and welcomes them to his domain, regardless of how they enter. Even if the heroes killed the <strong>Gamorreans </strong>to get inside, <strong>Switch </strong>seems unfazed. As a protocol droid, he has no concept of the fragility or the value of life, a fact that makes him both easy to get along with and incredibly dangerous. After introducing himself and<strong> @Actor[cNjMiBv8BiJ5nvSy]{R5-B8}</strong>, <strong>Switch </strong>offers the heroes a drink from his extensive collection of beverages; for a droid that does not consume, he has exceptionally refined tastes. Once his guests have been made comfortable, <strong>Switch </strong>explains that his services are available to anyone who can pay, and he implores the heroes to tell him why they have come.</p>\n<p>The heroes have several challenges throughout their encounter with <strong>Switch</strong>, though only one is critical to the ongoing plot of the adventure. They must convince the droid to reveal the location of the cargo he is keeping for <strong>Maya </strong>and to turn that cargo over to them. The following encounter challenges demonstrate how the heroes can affect the outcome of the encounter:</p>\n<h4>Critical Challenge</h4>\n<p>The heroes need to get their hands on whatever cargo <strong>Switch </strong>is holding for the Alderaanian Security officer, <strong>Maya</strong>. If they can make a <strong>DC 17 Persuasion check</strong>, <strong>Switch </strong>acknowledges that he is holding cargo for <strong>Maya </strong>but does not tell them where. If they manage to get <strong>Switch </strong>talking, however, their options expand greatly.</p>\n<p>Once <strong>Switch </strong>has been persuaded to admit possession of <strong>Maya's </strong>cargo, he is willing to accept payment to release it to the heroes. For the “<em><strong>eminently reasonable</strong></em>” sum of <strong>1,000 credits</strong>, they can take the cargo wherever they wish. If the heroes don’t have that much money, or if they don’t want to spend that much, <strong>Switch </strong>is willing to accept less, provided that one or more of the heroes agrees to supply him with information on a regular basis from wherever their travels may take them. Each hero who agrees to this deal reduces the required payment by <strong>200 credits</strong>. Of course, the heroes can agree with no intentions of sending information to <strong>Switch </strong>in the future, but doing so might have dire repercussions. (Any such consequences are beyond the scope of this adventure, but feel free to include your own adventures and enemies later in the campaign.) On the other hand, the heroes might like the idea of working for a droid crime lord, even indirectly, which can open up plot hooks of its own.</p>\n<p>Once <strong>Switch </strong>is satisfied, he reveals that the cargo is in the <strong>main docking bay on Blue Deck</strong>, a section of the station heavily traveled by Imperial loyalists and one of the few places where Imperial ships dock. If the heroes fail to convince <strong>Switch </strong>to give them the cargo, they might have another chance to succeed; see the development section of “<em><strong>Arrival of Ganga Lor</strong></em>” (below).</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 1</h4>\n<p>Whether or not <strong>Switch </strong>agrees to turn the cargo over to the heroes, he does not freely volunteer the nature of the valuable goods. However, a simple bribe of <strong>50 credits</strong> is enough to get him to reveal the secret. The cargo is, in fact, <strong>another agent</strong> of Alderaanian Security who has been <strong>frozen in carbonite</strong> for transport from the<strong> Deep Core</strong> world of <strong>Empress Teta</strong>. The agent had himself frozen so that he could be transported as cargo rather than as a passenger, reducing the chance that the Empire would find and arrest him.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 2</h4>\n<p>After learning that they will be obtaining a person <strong>frozen in carbonite</strong>, the heroes might press <strong>Switch </strong>for more information on why the agent was smuggling himself from <strong>Empress Teta</strong>. This information requires a bribe of <strong>200 credits</strong>, which the droid accepts only if the heroes were able to persuade him. If the bribe is paid, <strong>Switch </strong>reveals that the Alderaanian Security agent was spying on the Empire’s secret interests in the<strong> Deep Core</strong>. In the months since the rise of the Empire, hundreds of warships have sealed off the few known trade routes into the <strong>Deep Core</strong>, only allowing wealthy Imperial loyalists in or out of that region of space. Over the last few months, the Empire has set up the <strong>Deep Core Security Zone</strong>, and <strong>Emperor Palpatine</strong> himself has overseen the transfer of large amounts of resources and nobles loyal to the Empire into the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. The <strong>frozen security agent </strong>had been scouting one of the dozens of worlds that the Empire had discovered during its recent expansion into the <strong>Deep Core</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 3</h4>\n<p>In addition to the possibility of working for <strong>Switch</strong>, the heroes have a chance to make the droid a permanent contact and ally in the <strong>Core Worlds</strong>. If the heroes managed to persuade him, <strong>Switch </strong>is open to the idea of providing information the heroes need, wherever they may be. However, convincing <strong>Switch </strong>that this is a good idea is a bit more difficult. A down payment of <strong>500 credits</strong> is enough to convince the droid that a deal is in his best interests. Other kinds of compensation work as well, provided that any items offered have a market value of roughly <strong>500 credits</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 4</h4>\n<p>Once the heroes convince <strong>Switch </strong>to turn over <strong>Maya’s </strong>cargo, they also have the opportunity to make a bit of a profit. In addition to the cargo he is holding for <strong>Maya</strong>, <strong>Switch</strong> has a crate of bottles of Corellian ale that is bound for <strong>Alderaan</strong>. If, over the course of their conversations with the protocol droid, the heroes mention that they have access to a ship, <strong>Switch </strong>offers them a small fee to deliver the ale to <strong>Alderaan</strong>, with the promise of <strong>500 additional credits</strong> on delivery. The Corellian ale is stored in the same docking bay as the frozen security officer, in a crate that can be carried by a single person. If the heroes agree to deliver the crate, they can do so without complications once they arrive on <strong>Alderaan</strong>. The credits will be sent to an account that <strong>Switch </strong>sets up on <strong>Alderaan</strong>, from which the heroes can easily retrieve their payment.</p>\n<h4>Ad-Hoc XP Award</h4>\n<p>If the heroes successfully negotiate with <strong>Switch</strong> for the <strong>frozen Alderaanian Security agent</strong>, award them experience points as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 2 opponent</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Arrival of Ganga Lor</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have concluded their business with <strong>Switch</strong>, an unexpected visitor arrives. If the heroes left the <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> alive, they now die squealing amid a hail of blaster bolts, which can easily be heard from inside bay <strong>V14</strong>. Bursting into the room is <strong>@Actor[qGw8StGUCpTJCd2i]{Ganga Lor}</strong>, a Chevin gangster, and a handful of his thugs. When he pushes his way into the room, <strong>Ganga Lor</strong> shouts in Basic, “<em><strong>So you thought you could hide your deal with the offworlders from me, droid? I’m tired of not getting my cut! Turn him into a scrap heap, boys!</strong></em>” With that, <strong>Ganga Lor’s</strong> thugs attack <strong>Switch </strong>and the heroes, who are now caught up in a gang fight.</p>\n<h2>Ganga Lor’s Grudge - CR 3</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[7vPUSWkX2A6AXumu]{1-02 Ganga Lor’s Grudge}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p><strong>Switch </strong>is most grateful for the heroes’ assistance in the fight. If they had not yet convinced the droid to turn over <strong>Maya’s</strong> cargo, he agrees to do so now (otherwise, he agrees to one of the auxiliary challenges free of charge). Additionally, if the heroes need medical attention, he promises to call in a favor with <strong>Dr. Fenn</strong> of <strong>Delgas Medical Supplies</strong> to get them treated free of charge.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Switch </strong>does not survive the encounter, the heroes can learn the location of <strong>Maya’s </strong>cargo by slicing into the computer in his desk (<strong>DC 18</strong>).</p>\n<p>When the encounter with <strong>Switch</strong> is concluded, the heroes can head to <strong>Blue Deck’s</strong> main docking bay and retrieve the cargo.</p>\n<h2>Blue Deck</h2>\n<p><strong>Blue Deck</strong> is one of the nicest and most dangerous sections of <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. Reserved almost exclusively for Imperial loyalists and off-duty personnel, <strong>Blue Deck</strong> is a combination of luxury and fanatical devotion to the Empire. Everything on <strong>Blue Deck </strong>is pristine and well maintained, with none of the technical problems seen elsewhere on the station. Propaganda posters for <strong>Emperor Palpatine</strong> cover the walls, and the insignia of the Empire is found almost everywhere the eye can see. <strong>@Actor[LtlZ2iNX2RaN85CP]{Security Officers} </strong>guard every entrance and exit to <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, and while they examine everyone closely, they make no move to stop anyone from coming or going - at least, not often.</p>\n<p>The anti-alien bias encountered on the <strong>Promenade </strong>is even worse here. Shopkeepers steadfastly refuse to serve non-Humans, and <strong>cantina bouncers</strong> prevent them even from entering the establishments. Very few aliens walk the halls of <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, and those that do are usually servants or slaves of nobles and Imperial agents.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive on <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the turbolift doors slide open and you step out onto Blue Deck, it is like entering a wholly different space station. The floors are polished and possess a metallic sheen, and the massive windows along one wall grant the most magnificent view of Brentaal available on the station. Maintenance and service droids flit about from one place to the next, keeping everything clean and ordered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Moving about the halls of Blue Deck are large numbers of Humans, most of them wealthy by all appearances. They pay little attention to the few aliens found in the area, except, perhaps, to sneer as they pass.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When the heroes reach <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, they might head directly to the <strong>main docking bay</strong>, which is fine but leaves them ignorant of developments in the hangar bay. If the heroes take the time to make a <strong>DC 10 Investigation check</strong> to retrieve local news and rumors, they discover that the Empire has just sent an entire squad of <strong>security officers </strong>to the main docking bay to check out some suspicious cargo. If the heroes do not try to make an investigation check, they can learn the same information by making a successful <strong>DC 20 Perception check </strong>to overhear two nobles talking about the situation.</p>\n<h3>Skig Banos, Imperial Informant</h3>\n<p>As the heroes make their way across <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, they see a face that might be familiar. Any heroes who managed to notice the two Imperial informants on the <strong>Promenade</strong> before <strong>Maya </strong>approached them now also notice a similarly dressed man on <strong>Blue Deck</strong>. In fact, any hero who succeeds on a <strong>DC 15 Perception check </strong>realizes that this man was on the <strong>Promenade</strong> earlier but fled at the first sign of blaster fire. The man is <strong>@Actor[QncwLbC3mZYETt2S]{Skig Banos}</strong>, an Imperial informant and world-class coward. With a mop of greasy black hair and a physique that is little more than skin hanging off bones, <strong>Skig </strong>looks a bit on the pathetic side. His beady eyes and oversized nose give him a more sinister edge, causing him to resemble a wild womp rat eager to escape captivity.</p>\n<p>If the heroes confront <strong>Skig</strong>, he immediately tries to escape. If the heroes manage to stop him without making too much of a ruckus, they should be able to interrogate him and get a bit more information about what is going on. <strong>Skig </strong>is too afraid of being harmed by the heroes to raise an alarm, and though he acts unfriendly at first, a successful <strong>DC 17 Persuasion check</strong> can make him more amenable. Similarly, a successful<strong> DC 12 Intimidation check</strong> can make him more helpful.</p>\n<p>If either of these <strong>checks </strong>succeed, <strong>Skig</strong> is willing to tell the heroes almost anything so that they will let him go. This includes lying to them - he makes<strong> Deception checks </strong>every round at <strong>+2</strong> until caught in a lie - and<strong> Skig’s</strong> lies include that <strong>the Empire has discovered them</strong>, that<strong> the Empire has killed Maya</strong>, and that he’s <strong>just a merchant out for a walk</strong> on <strong>Blue Deck</strong>. An indifferent <strong>Skig </strong>simply wants to get away, and he does everything he can to escape without getting killed or raising an alarm. Truthfully, <strong>Skig </strong>is equally scared of the Empire and fears that they will betray him at any time.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Skig</strong> can be made friendly, he actually volunteers useful information. He knows that the Imperials were recently tipped off about contraband in the<strong> main docking bay</strong> (by one of <strong>Ganga Lor’s</strong> toadies looking to make a few quick credits, though <strong>Skig </strong>doesn’t know that) and have gone to investigate. He saw at least three <strong>security officers</strong> and their <strong>sergeant</strong> head toward the docking bay, though he thinks there may be more in the bay. Additionally, <strong>Skig </strong>saw them moving a repulsor sled into the main docking bay, meaning that they have some heavier weapons at their disposal. With this information in hand, the heroes should be a bit better prepared for the fight ahead of them.</p>\n<h3>Main Docking Bay</h3>\n<p>The <strong>main docking bay</strong> on <strong>Blue Deck</strong> is used by the Empire to ferry cargo and personnel from the station to the surface of <strong>Brentaal </strong>and back. <strong>Switch </strong>managed to get <strong>Maya’s </strong>cargo stored here by calling in some favors, reasoning that the Empire would not think anyone would be bold enough to hide contraband right under their noses.</p>\n<p>The <strong>main docking bay</strong> is a large, open area with a control room and two side storage rooms.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Frozen Goods - CR 3</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[2IE4GDrB8C3EB0Ag]{1-03 Frozen Goods}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Once the heroes obtain the <strong>agent frozen in carbonite</strong>, it quickly becomes time to get away from the Imperial presence on<strong> Sel Zonn Station</strong>. If the heroes managed to save <strong>Maya</strong>, she awaits their call on the comlink and sends one of her allies to pick them up. A short <strong>5 rounds</strong> after the heroes call <strong>Maya</strong> for assistance, a large Baudo-class Star Yacht named the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>drifts into the main docking bay and lowers its ramp. Over the loudspeaker, the ship’s captain, a woman named <strong>@Actor[TgAWl2DRpBm2ZdsF]{Sirona Okeefe}</strong>, calls out to the heroes that <strong>Maya </strong>sent her to fetch them. When the heroes all board the ship, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> blasts off from <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> and makes a quick jump to hyperspace, headed for <strong>Alderaan</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes did not save <strong>Maya</strong>, you (the GM) have several options. The heroes might have met <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> previously on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, or she might have been referred to them by <strong>Switch</strong>, who knew that they would need transport off the station. Failing that, the heroes might need to take their cargo and find a place to hide on the station until they can hire passage to <strong>Alderaan </strong>or stow away on a ship. Regardless, the heroes should take the <strong>frozen agent</strong> to <strong>Alderaan </strong>as quickly as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note:</strong> escaping <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Rendezvous on Alderaan</h2>\n<p>Eventually, the heroes should make their way to <strong>Alderaan </strong>to rendezvous with<strong> Bail Organa</strong>. <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> can take the characters to meet with the <strong>Senator</strong>, and she encourages them to relax and recuperate during the journey to the peaceful planet of <strong>Alderaan</strong>. Feel free to use this time to allow the heroes to return to full health and take care of anything they need to do during the trip through hyperspace. The journey to <strong>Alderaan</strong> goes off without a hitch, and as the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> soars over the planet, the heroes enjoy a great view of the beautiful landscape of the world. Any heroes near the cockpit overhear <strong>Aldera’s spaceport control tower </strong>clearing the ship to land at the <strong>Royal Palace’s </strong>landing pad.</p>\n<p>When the heroes disembark, they are immediately greeted by several <strong>Alderaanian honor guards</strong> and one of <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> <strong>servants</strong>, who escorts them into the palace and to the <strong>Grand Hall</strong>—an ornately decorated chamber where the royalty of <strong>Alderaan </strong>holds court. The heroes are given refreshments and asked to wait on <strong>Organa’s </strong>arrival. During this time, the <strong>Senator’s servants</strong> unload the precious cargo from the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>and set about releasing the <strong>Alderaanian Security agent </strong>from the carbonite. The heroes aren’t kept waiting long; <strong>Senator Organa</strong> arrives soon.</p>\n<h3>Meeting with Bail Organa</h3>\n<p>The encounter with <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Bail Organa}</strong> should be short and should set the heroes on the path that will carry them throughout the <em><strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong></em> campaign. The meeting should impress upon them the magnitude of their discovery. To be invited into the palace of an Imperial Senator and famous diplomat like <strong>Bail Organa</strong> is something that most citizens can only dream about, and the discussion that follows is all the more remarkable for the simple fact that the <strong>Senator’s </strong>power can shape the lives of billions.<strong> Be sure to emphasize the gravity of the situation</strong> and how exceptional it is for a <strong>Senator </strong>to request the aid of unknowns.</p>\n<p>When the heroes have made themselves comfortable in the palace, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The doors to the Grand Hall open, and in strides a middle-aged man who has a well-kept goatee and is wearing Senatorial robes. Easily recognizable as Bail Organa, he smiles and nods to the servants before turning to you. “Welcome to Alderaan,” he says. “I had hoped we might meet under more pleasant circumstances, but unfortunately the Empire makes almost everything unpleasant. Still, I am glad to see that the... difficulties at the spaceport above Brentaal didn’t impede you too much.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I’ve asked you to join me today because the agents of mine that you rescued seem to think you can be trusted.

A little over a week ago, that communication stopped. My agents tell me that the Admiral has been taken to Felucia, where he is being held against his will. I’d like you to learn what has become of him, and rescue him if you can.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/Bail%20Organa%201.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"407\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[99XZKKGQ31FHWYQ2]{02 - Handout 2 - Senator Bail Organa}</p>\n<p>After <strong>Organa </strong>delivers his proposition, the heroes probably have a number of questions. Here are some possible answers to likely questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who is this admiral? </strong>“<em>Admiral Gilder Varth is a veteran of the Clone Wars and an honorable man. He commanded one of the ships at the Battle of Coruscant and was promoted for bravery. His loyalty to the Empire seemed unwavering, but once you’ve seen what he has seen . . .</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What kind of opposition will we face? </strong>“<em>The Imperial presence on Felucia is light. The facility itself is a secret, so they do not advertise its presence with large numbers of troops. Our knowledge of the facility’s existence is our greatest advantage. Additionally, you shouldn’t be going anywhere near the planet’s major cities, so you should be able to travel largely undetected.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What is Felucia like? </strong>“<em>Dense overgrowth, huge fungi, and massive creatures are the order of the day on Felucia. It’s a wild, untamed planet, and you should be careful to avoid much of the local wildlife.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What’s in it for us? </strong>“<em>Each of you will receive 2,000 credits, and if things go well, I will guarantee more work when you return. Additionally, if the Admiral has as much information as I believe he does, this could be an excellent chance to strike a blow at the Galactic Empire.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sirona Okeefe and the <em>Banshee</em></h2>\n<p>If the heroes agree to discover the fate of<strong> Admiral Varth</strong>, <strong>Senator Organa</strong> tells them that he has arranged transport aboard a vessel owned and operated by one of his longtime friends. <strong>Sirona Okeefe</strong> is a free trader and transport pilot who frequently works for <strong>Organa </strong>and his agents — most recently, <strong>Maya</strong>. On retainer from the <strong>Senator</strong>, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is a beautiful middle-aged woman who knows her way around the galaxy. For the first arc of the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, her modified Baudo-class Star Yacht, the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>, will serve as the heroes’ primary mode of transportation. <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is fiercely loyal to <strong>Senator Organa</strong> and trusts the heroes only because he does.</p>\n<p>The <strong>captain</strong> is something of a black sheep in her family (which hails from <strong>Brentaal</strong>) and doesn’t care to speak about her past. She does mention that she has a niece who aspires to follow in her footsteps. Otherwise, <strong>Okeefe </strong>always keeps the conversation light and flirty. <strong>Captain Okeefe </strong>is also very fond of her droid copilot, an <strong>RX-13 </strong>pilot droid nicknamed “<em><strong>Crash</strong></em>,” who is curmudgeonly and prefers to gripe about nearly everything rather than go about his duties. Still, the two make a good pair — the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> runs smoothly and has a number of special modifications that make it more than a match for Imperial patrols.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/Sirona_Okeefe_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"473\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">@JournalEntry[d6pPqVXtgSLj9jvM]{07 - Handout 7 - Sirona Okeefe}</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[TgAWl2DRpBm2ZdsF]{Sirona Okeefe}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[FosVtZziT8sp1hFP]{RX-13, AKA \"Crash\"}</strong></p>\n<h3>The Banshee</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[DuuwF8UYgQsQ7NgL]{Banshee}</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/Baudo-Class_Star_Yacht.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"671\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LLB1oXwD6dkBwClH]{03 - Handout 2 - The Banshee}</p>","folder":"ltQz712CRglJoUNT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"KndUY0S1XhQyOUw9","name":"Part 1: Pursuing the Hutt","content":"<h1>Part 1: Pursuing the Hutt</h1>\n<p>In <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>, the players pursue the notorious gangster<strong> Darga the Hutt </strong>to <strong>Bespin,</strong> having followed him from his <strong>palace</strong> on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. <strong>Darga </strong>fled to <strong>Cloud City</strong> in his luxury yacht, then (with a hefty amount of bribery to city officials) went deep into hiding. So deep into hiding, in fact, that no amount of information gathering, intimidation, or bribery will get the players anywhere close to him. However, all is not lost; the players have a chance to discover a place where they might be able to find more clues leading to the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> whereabouts: the <strong>Cloud City</strong> <strong>Sabacc Tournament</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Arrival on Bespin</h2>\n<p>In <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, the players left <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> and headed to <strong>Bespin</strong> in pursuit of the Hutt <strong>crime lord.</strong> However, your players may not have come directly to <strong>Bespin,</strong> and in fact it’s very likely they didn’t. If your players decide to stop at the rendezvous point to touch base with the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, pick up supplies, and drop off <strong>Master Denia</strong> so that she can receive proper medical attention, allow them to do so. Though a sense of urgency should hasten their steps, there is no reason for them not to come to <strong>Bespin</strong> fully rested, supplied, and ready to tackle whatever challenges <strong>Darga </strong>throws at them. However, neither <strong>Captain Verana</strong> nor any of the other members of the Alderaanian resistance have any more information or <strong>credits</strong> for the players. They are welcome to rest and recuperate aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, but their mission is not yet finished.</p>\n<p>When the players eventually make it to <strong>Bespin,</strong> they find it a far more hospitable environment than either <strong>Felucia </strong>or <strong>Cato Neimoidia.</strong> Though <strong>Cloud City</strong> has not yet reached the prominence it will enjoy under <strong>Lando Calrissian</strong> years later, it is still a wealthy settlement where entrepreneurs have made small fortunes for themselves. When the players drop out of hyperspace, <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> Message to Spacers instructs them to contact spaceport control to request permission to land. Additionally, the message advertises the upcoming <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong>—the players’ first hint that there is a big event coming up.</p>\n<p>Like the rest of the people on <strong>Cloud City,</strong> the spaceport controllers are looking to make a few extra <strong>credits</strong> here and there. When the players (or <strong>Captain Okeefe,</strong> if she is still ferrying the players around) contact the spaceport, they are told that “<em><strong>as a result of heavy tourist traffic from the sabacc tournament, each ship will be assigned a landing priority.</strong></em>” The spaceport authorities assign the players a landing priority that would make them wait close to <strong>12 hours</strong> to land. Fortunately, a little diplomacy and a few <strong>credits</strong> can easily grease the wheels of bureaucracy and get them a higher priority. Offering a bribe of at least <strong>300 credits</strong> is enough to let the players land within the <strong>hour,</strong> and the controllers are able to electronically transfer the funds directly from the players’ accounts if they so desire.</p>\n<p>Arrival on <strong>Cloud City</strong> is unlike arrival on most other worlds. The approach path given by the spaceport controllers takes the players on a beautiful tour of the city, obviously meant to show off the planet’s wealth, and finally brings the players in to land at one of the many civilian docking bays glimpsed on their approach. When the players disembark, they find several <strong>Cloud City</strong> customs officials waiting on them. Though they bear no Imperial insignia, they seem to hold themselves with the same self-assured arrogance that agents of the Empire always display.</p>\n<p>The customs officials demand the right to thoroughly search the ship for contraband, a statement that sends <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> into a sputtering fury. She argues vehemently with one of the customs agents, while two others watch placidly. If the players intervene, the situation can be defused calmly in a number of ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credits</strong> seem to be the grease in the wheels of <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> bureaucracy, and offering a bribe of <strong>500 credits</strong> for each of the three customs agents <strong>(1,500 credits</strong> in total) causes them to “waive the needless inspection” for the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em></li>\n<li>Attempting to smooth talk or intimidate the agents is also possible, as each customs agent is little more than a low level bureaucrat with little real authority. Have the players make a <strong>DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Intimidate)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of the resolution to the customs shakedown, the players should come away with two important pieces of information that can help them in this adventure: <strong>credits</strong> can accomplish almost anything on <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and security has been tightened up as a result of the upcoming <strong>sabacc tournament</strong>. In fact, security is so tight that the customs officials have one more duty before departing, a duty that no amount of <strong>bribery</strong> or <strong>diplomacy</strong> can overcome. No lethal weapons are allowed in the main areas of <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and the players must agree to leave any weapons other than <em>hidden blades</em>, <em>small daggers</em> or <em>batons</em> on the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em> Of course, players can always attempt to hide their weapons from the customs officials using a <strong>DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</strong>, but the penalty for discovery with a weapon is to have the weapon confiscated and the perpetrator forcibly removed from <strong>Cloud City</strong>. Later, the players will have a chance to gain some exemption from these restrictions, but for the first part of the adventure, they must either hide their weapons or leave them on the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Cloud City</h2>\n<p><strong>Cloud City</strong> is a beautiful tourist city that also serves as a major mining outpost for the collection and spin-sealing of <strong>Tibanna gas,</strong> which is used in <em>blaster</em> weapons. When walking through the corridors of the city, the players are treated to beautiful vistas of the gas giant <strong>Bespin,</strong> and architecture designed to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Most of the residents of <strong>Cloud City</strong> are Humans, though occasionally the players will see a handful of Ugnaughts walking close to one another in tight packs. The Ugnaughts seem to keep to themselves and are mostly ignored by the Humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud City</strong> <strong>Wing Guards</strong> (the security forces of <strong>Cloud City</strong>) stand watch over most of the major thoroughfares in the city, and rarely is one very far from the players. Many of the businessmen and nobles walking through the corridors of the city have their own security escort, but they seem to pay no attention to the players, regardless of their appearances or species. Most residents on <strong>Cloud City</strong> are too concerned about their own wealth or recreation to spend much time worrying about galactic politics, and there is no visible Imperial presence in the city.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Cloud City Wing Guard</strong> keeps a close eye on anyone acting suspicious, especially this close to the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> They are always on the lookout for someone possessing weapons, but in order to maintain a pleasant atmosphere for the tourist trade, they rarely shake down visitors unless there is a clear reason to do so. The atmosphere in the city is one of buzzing anticipation, as the <strong>tournament</strong> has drawn visitors from all corners of the galaxy, as it does every year. The players are likely to learn that the <strong>tournament</strong> is just <strong>days away</strong>, and that hundreds of players have already arrived to buy into the event.</p>\n<h2>A Few Wrong Questions</h2>\n<p>Once the players have made their way through customs, their most likely course of action is to seek out <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. Knowing that he was headed to <strong>Bespin</strong> in his personal luxury yacht, the players will want to know whether he is here, and if so, where the slimy <strong>Hutt</strong> is hiding. The most straightforward method is to make <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong>, but regardless of the <strong>check </strong>results, the information provided is always the same: no one has seen or heard from<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>. Most citizens don’t know the first thing about the <strong>crime lord,</strong> and they seem affronted that the players would suspect them of associating with criminal types.</p>\n<p>Digging deeper turns up few leads. Computer-savvy players might try to break into the <strong>Cloud City</strong> computer system to see if any record of <strong>Darga’s </strong>arrival is in the spaceport logs. The city’s central computer system is one of the most sophisticated central computers in existence. The computer is unfriendly to anyone who accesses it from a location other than a designated high-security area providing a <strong>DC 27 Intelligence (Slicer's Kit) check</strong>, but if the players manage to sneak into or break into a <strong>Wing Guard security post,</strong> they can access the central computer with a friendly attitude providing a<strong> DC 22 Intelligence (Slicer's Kit) check</strong>. However, even this much effort proves mostly fruitless. The players discover a spaceport log entry for the arrival of a luxury yacht called the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot,</strong></em> whose port of origin is registered as <strong>Cato Neimoidia,</strong> but the docking information seems to have been erased, with no ability to retrieve it. Though the players will probably suspect that <strong>Darga </strong>is on <strong>Cloud City</strong> (no departure information was given for the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot),</strong></em> they have no idea where the ship is. With all of the luxury vessels arriving at <strong>Cloud City</strong> for the <strong>tournament,</strong> finding a specific yacht is going to prove nearly impossible, and the players should realize that doing so could take <strong>weeks</strong> even under the best of conditions.</p>\n<p>If the players become discouraged at their difficulties (as they likely will), an event unfolds that should give them hope. When they make contact with <strong>Captain Okeefe,</strong> she tells them that a message was delivered electronically to the <em><strong>Banshee,</strong></em> addressed to them. The message simply states, “<em><strong>If you are wise, you will stop asking so many questions. It is a long drop through the clouds, and enemies of the Hutt have a bad habit of vanishing.</strong></em>” <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> tells the players that her droid copilot, <strong>Crash,</strong> has managed to trace the message back to a computer terminal in one of the more industrial areas of <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and can give them directions using the city’s map if they want to find the person who sent the message</p>\n<h2>The Parliament of Guilds</h2>\n<p>Following the directions they received from <strong>Captain Okeefe,</strong> the players leave the tourist areas of <strong>Cloud City</strong> and begin descending into the industrial sector. Humans become less and less common, and Ugnaughts outnumber other species almost two to one in these areas. The directions lead the players to an office marked “<em><strong>Parliament of Guilds— Sector U357,</strong></em>” which appears to be little more than a bureaucratic office. Inside, the players find nearly a dozen Ugnaughts working behind desks and at computer terminals. When the players enter the Parliament office, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the door to the office slides open, over a dozen Ugnaughts look up from computer terminals or end conversations with one another abruptly. There is a long moment of silence as the Ugnaught workers all turn their eyes toward you. Breaking the silence, one of the Ugnaughts squeals and grabs another by the coat, shaking his comrade roughly.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I told you they would find us!” the Ugnaught shouts. “You’ve brought them down on us, all because of your meddling! They will kill us for sure!”</em></p>\n<p><em>The second Ugnaught, fighting desperately to break free of his companion’s grasp, cries out pleadingly. “We don’t know that they work for the Hutt! Maybe they could help us.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After struggling with each other for a few more moments (or less, if the players intervene), the two Ugnaughts separate, and the first turns to the players, begging for his life. He introduces himself as <strong>Krygg</strong> and explains that they meant no harm with the message. His shaken companion, who identifies himself as <strong>Fyren,</strong> tells the players (in a much less fearful tone) that they noticed the players snooping around after <strong>Darga </strong>and figured that they might be enemies of the <strong>Hutt.</strong> Rebuking <strong>Krygg</strong> for his spinelessness, <strong>Fyren</strong> invites the players to join him in his office. The two Ugnaughts escort the players to a very small, cramped office (built for Ugnaught-sized inhabitants), where they explain further exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>According to <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg,</strong> ever since <strong>Darga</strong> set up his ancillary operation in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> it has caused no end of trouble for the Ugnaughts, particularly those involved in the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong>, <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> ruling body. When <strong>Darga</strong> first set up shop in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> he began bribing a number of Ugnaughts working for <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> (the company responsible for all <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> exports from <strong>Bespin)</strong> in order to siphon off some of the spin-sealed <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> for sale on the black market. When <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> discovered the missing <strong>Tibanna gas,</strong> they began taking their complaints to the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong>. Knowing that the Ugnaughts were responsible for the missing gas, but not knowing which ones, the <strong>Parliament</strong> had no choice but to issue tougher restrictions on all Ugnaughts. Over time, the situation has degenerated to the point where the Ugnaughts’ reputation is close to being ruined.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyren</strong> explains that, when they noticed the players searching for <strong>Darga</strong>, he sent them a message to dissuade them from seeking the <strong>Hutt</strong> further. <strong>Fyren</strong> says that he was just trying to stop them from getting too involved in dealings with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> but <strong>Krygg</strong> accuses his companion of leaving a trail for the players to follow, hoping they would come to assist. <strong>Fyren</strong> admits that he finds it fortunate that the players have come, and if they will help the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong> root out the Ugnaughts on <strong>Darga’s </strong>payroll, he and <strong>Krygg</strong> will provide information that could help them in their search for the missing <strong>Hutt.</strong> The Ugnaughts explain that they were considering dealing with their criminal comrades themselves, but they believe that the players are more suited to (and likely more experienced in) dealing with those in <strong>Darga’s </strong>employ. <strong>Fyren</strong> explains that they don’t necessarily want the players to kill the Ugnaughts that <strong>Darga </strong>has bought, but that such losses would be understandable if the players found no peaceful way to resolve the situation.</p>\n<p>If the players agree to the exchange, the Ugnaughts share one piece of information with the players in good faith—they know that <strong>Darga </strong>has been dealing with the Empire, and they believe that a transaction is about to take place. If the players take care of their problem, <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> agree to share the rest of what they know. To get them started, the two Ugnaughts tell the players that they have tracked the source of the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> being sold on the black market to one of their gas storage areas in the bowels of the city. They give the players directions for getting there, but they also provide a warning: The <strong>Wing Guard</strong> rarely goes into those depths, so the players will be on their own down there.</p>\n<h2>Discovering the Bought Ugnaughts</h2>\n<p>Following the directions given to them by <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg,</strong> the players can make their way to one of the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> storage areas. When they enter the storage area, read the following description aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The air is damp, and the acrid smell of smoke is thick here. The corridors are cramped, clearly designed for workers of smaller stature, and heavy machinery, some of it rusting and extremely aged, litters the area. The sound of metal-on-metal is almost deafening in places, and many of the machines look corroded and covered in a green-tinted sludge, byproducts of the Tibanna gas spin-sealing process. Unlike the rest of the city, this area seems more like an aging factory than a luxury resort.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> storage chambers are unguarded, though the players eventually stop seeing anyone—Human or Ugnaught—moving through these corridors well before they find who they are looking for. When the players move into a spin-sealing chamber, allow them to make <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> to hear over the sound of the heavy machinery that lies ahead. Those who succeed overhear a grunting conversation between several Ugnaughts. Any players who speak the Ugnaught language can tell that there are workers ahead, arguing with one another over the amount of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> to siphon from a shipment going out this afternoon. They are clearly working with machinery as well, and the sounds fill the corridor almost completely.</p>\n<p>If the players approach cautiously and are not spotted, they can see further evidence that they have found their quarry. The Ugnaughts have connected a small pump to one of the massive <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> storage tanks (which is clearly labeled in <strong>Basic, Bocce,</strong> and a <strong>dozen other languages</strong>) and are transferring the gas into dozens of smaller containers, each small enough for an Ugnaught to carry.</p>\n<p>If the players try to talk to the Ugnaughts, they are wary, beginning with an unfriendly attitude toward the players. Having been caught doing something illegal—not to mention being in the employ of a Hutt <strong>crime lord</strong>—they are extremely paranoid about outsiders. However, if the players are not initially hostile, the Ugnaughts avoid going for their weapons. The boss, clearly the ringleader of this gang of thieves, believes that the other Ugnaughts on <strong>Cloud City</strong> are too set in their ways and doesn’t believe that they would lift a hand against him. If the players pursue any reasonable course of discussion (including using <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Deception) checks</strong>), feel free to let the situation develop naturally. <strong>Bribery</strong> is <strong>unlikely</strong> to work; the Ugnaughts know that they wouldn’t be able to spend the <strong>credits</strong> if the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong> or <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> got its hands on them. The Ugnaughts are unwilling to turn themselves in to the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong>, and if there is any hint that the players are there to facilitate such a turn of events, the encounter can turn hostile in a hurry.</p>\n<h2>Tibanna Gas Refinery</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[qovIBmWwWpfYHkYX]{3-01 Tibanna Gas Refinery}</strong></p>\n<p>After the players have dealt with the Ugnaughts in <strong>Darga’s </strong>employ, they can return to <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> to complete the transaction. If the players brought some or all of the Ugnaughts to the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong> without killing them, <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> are extremely pleased and thank the players for helping to restore some of the reputation their people had lost. If all of the offending Ugnaughts were killed, <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> are saddened, but they agree that sometimes unsavory steps must be taken.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the players learn the rest of what the two Ugnaughts know about <strong>Darga’s </strong>dealings on <strong>Cloud City.</strong> According to <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg,</strong> the <strong>Hutt</strong> has long been taking the Tibanna gas siphoned from <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> and selling it to the Empire. The transactions are usually discrete, and they have been unable to learn what <strong>Darga</strong> gets out of the deal. However, they know that the next transaction will take place during the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> Fyren suggests that the players visit the <strong>Yerith Bespin hotel</strong> (one of the finest in the city) or the Royal Casino (where this year’s tournament is to be held). Though the Empire rarely makes itself known on <strong>Cloud City,</strong> so many strangers have arrived in the last few days that almost anyone, including Imperial agents, could be involved in the tournament.</p>\n<h2>Imperial Dealings</h2>\n<p>Having learned about the exchange between <strong>Darga’s agents </strong>and the Empire that will take place during the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament,</strong> the players will likely set out to explore the locales mentioned by the Ugnaughts. If they investigate the <strong>Royal Casino</strong>, they find that the entire establishment has been closed down in preparation for the tournament, and several <strong>Wing Guards</strong> block anyone from entering. From the outside, the players can see workers and technicians inside the casino, working diligently to make sure that every table is spotless, every <strong>sabacc dealer droid</strong> is functioning, and every room is well lit.</p>\n<p>At the <strong>Yerith Bespin,</strong> however, the players have a bit of good fortune. As they enter the lobby of the hotel, they hear a loud argument between a Human male and one of the desk workers. Everyone in earshot can hear the man complaining that his accommodations are unsatisfactory, and he demands that the hotel manager put him in a better room. Though the desk worker is doing his best to calm the man, the customer continues his arrogant tirade, heedless of how many people are watching. When the players enter the hotel lobby, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The opulent </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yerith Bespin</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> hotel is decorated extravagantly and is clearly one of the finest establishments in the galaxy. Beautifully woven carpets stretch from one side of the lobby to another, and crystalline chandeliers hover overhead, casting scintillating light down on the guests below. To one side of the room, a row of fine wooden desks house computer terminals for hotel employees, each of whom is helping finely dressed guests check in. One guest, however, seems to be taking issue with the service and is berating the hotel employee tending to him so loudly that everyone in the lobby has turned to stare. The Human man, dressed in the style of Core nobility, speaks with a precise accent even as he shouts at the desk worker, complaining about how unsuitable he finds the accommodations.</span></em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As the players approach, allow them to make a<strong> Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>with the information learnt based on the <strong>DC</strong> of the <strong>check,</strong> as shown below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DC 10:</strong> Just across the lobby, a small entourage of <strong>four Humans</strong> and <strong>two Theelin women</strong> (near-Humans with colorful hair and skin patterns) waits patiently for the shouting customer to air his complaints.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 15:</strong> The <strong>two Theelin </strong>are watching the man’s every move carefully and seem to be scanning the room looking for threats at the same time—clearly, they are <strong>bodyguards</strong> of some sort.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 20:</strong> The <strong>four Humans </strong>are all very similar; in fact, they could be <strong>quadruplets</strong> and are distinguished only by the scars they bear. Any player noticing this may make a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> with a success revealing the four men to be clones from the same stock as the <strong>clone troopers</strong> who fought for the Republic in the Clone Wars, but a bit older than the party might expect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a few moments, the argument at the desk subsides, and the <strong>nobleman</strong> seems to be mollified. He briskly strides over to the <strong>clones</strong> and his <strong>bodyguards</strong> and begins issuing orders in hushed tones while the hotel staff rushes off, apparently to see to his requests. The <strong>noble</strong> gathers his party and stalks off into the streets of <strong>Cloud City.</strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully by now, the players have realized that this <strong>noble</strong> has Imperial connections, and as such could lead them to more information about the Empire’s deal with <strong>Darga</strong>. If the noble or his <strong>bodyguards</strong> suspect that they are being followed, they react with hostility. Likewise, if the players approach the <strong>noble</strong> with questions about the Empire or <strong>Darga</strong>, he orders his <strong>bodyguards</strong> to deal with the unwanted intruders.</p>\n<h2>Imperial Threats</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[rJGowrXQOXO6q9Bx]{3-02 Imperial Threats}</strong></p>\n<p>Once the players have dealt with the <strong>noble</strong> and his <strong>guards,</strong> they can learn a good deal about who he is and why he is in <strong>Cloud City</strong> from a <em>datapad</em> on his person. The <em>datapad</em> contains travel logs that identify him as <strong>Baron Kithriss,</strong> a wealthy noble from <strong>Chandrila.</strong> The logs show that prior to coming to <strong>Bespin,</strong> he spent a great deal of time on a political retreat in the <strong>Deep Core,</strong> seemingly at <strong>Palpatine’s</strong> behest. <strong>Baron Kithriss’s</strong> <em>datapad</em> includes instructions to meet up with his “retainers” (the <strong>clone troopers)</strong> and travel to <strong>Bespin,</strong> securing accommodations at the <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> hotel and awaiting further instructions. Moreover, he is to let no one know that he is an agent for the Empire, and he must maintain complete communications silence except to receive instructions on his hotel computer. The <strong>Baron</strong> has his hotel <strong>access card</strong>, and savvy players should realize that they can use the <strong>card</strong> to gain access to his <strong>suite</strong> in the <strong>Yerith Bespin,</strong> granting them <strong>luxurious rooms</strong> for the duration of their stay and allowing them to intercept the <strong>Baron’s</strong> instructions from the Empire.

{"_id":"LBlyEEHvoZi0DEBE","name":"Part 2: Darga's Palace","content":"<h2>Part 2: Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have subdued <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, it is not hard to convince him to lead them to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>. The Devaronian is clearly terrified of what awaits him at the <strong>palace</strong>, but he is also afraid of the heroes, and as such he does not make any escape attempts. <strong>Raden </strong>has a speeder that can fit three passengers (or six, if they pile in on top of one another), and he wastes no time in zooming through the bridge city, weaving in and out of ruined buildings and taking shortcuts through the rubble. The trip to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> takes <strong>half an hour</strong>, and <strong>Raden’s </strong>winding course leads the heroes into a dense cluster of buildings that blocks out their view of the Cato Neimoidian sky.</p>\n<h2>Darga's Court</h2>\n<p>As the heroes approach <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, they see that it is cleverly hidden among the ruins of several destroyed Neimoidian palaces. In fact, on first approach, there seems to be nothing of importance in the area. But on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the Hutt’s <strong>palace</strong> is cobbled together from former Neimoidian estates. The entrance to the <strong>palace </strong>is a pair of massive blast doors, <strong>5 meters tall </strong>and carved with elaborate Hutt runes, set into the front wall. The doors appear to be unguarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Raden </strong>walks timidly up to one door, which has a small communications panel. He presses a button, sputters some phrases in Huttese (“<em><strong>This is Raden. I’ve come to deliver news to the mighty Darga. With all due respect, I require an audience.</strong></em>”), and steps back, fidgeting nervously. A long, quiet moment passes before two <strong>Nikto</strong> with <em>hunting blaster rifles</em> appear on battlements above the doors, weapons at the ready and pointed down at the visitors. A metal panel in the blast door scrapes as it is pulled aside, and a pair of glowing red eyes appear in the slit. A gravelly voice echoes from within the doors, again in Huttese (“<em><strong>You’re in for it now, Raden. Darga is expecting visitors, all right, but those creatures are not them.</strong></em>”), and the panel slams closed. A moment later, there is a heavy clank of metal on metal, and the blast doors part to either side. A rush of cold, dry air flows outward from the Hutt’s <strong>palace</strong>, and <strong>Raden </strong>motions the heroes to follow him inside.</p>\n<p>Entering the <strong>palace</strong>, there is no sign of who or what might have owned the glowing red eyes seen through the door panel. (They belong to <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, the Neimoidian majordomo, though the heroes won’t learn that until later.) The heroes follow <strong>Raden </strong>down a long, dark hallway illuminated at seemingly random intervals by torches set in sconces on the walls. Anyone passing through this hallway, including the heroes, feels that something is watching them from the darkness. Unmarked metal doors are set into the walls at various points, and the air is thick with the smell of dust and rotting wood.</p>\n<p>Moving deeper into the <strong>palace</strong>, the heroes get the sense that the building was once bright and beautiful. Any character who makes a successful<strong> DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check </strong>can tell that much of the architecture and trim is Neimoidian in design, and it becomes clear that the <strong>palace </strong>probably once belonged to a high-ranking member of the Trade Federation, perhaps an advisor to <strong>Nute Gunray.</strong> Eventually, <strong>Raden </strong>leads the heroes toward the soft sound of music and voices, which come from the Hutt’s <strong>throne room.</strong> When the heroes arrive in the room, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Darga’s throne room is both opulent and repulsive. A thick layer of oddly scented smoke drifts through the air, rising out of braziers in the corners of the room. Once-beautiful tapestries line the walls, though most of them have been torn, burned, or stained to the point that they are almost unrecognizable. A raised dais in the center of the room supports the massive bulk of Darga the Hutt, and behind his dais a large, open balcony seems to extend into darkness.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/darga_the_hutt_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"562\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[PQG318qeXuISSNPf]{02 - Handout 2 - Darga the Hutt}</p>\n<p>When <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> leads the heroes into the room, the sounds of conversation and music come to a halt. Silence reigns as every eye turns to watch <strong>Raden </strong>lead the visitors into an open space in front of the opulent dais. <strong>Darga’s </strong>eyes roll from the heroes to <strong>Raden</strong>, then sharpen quickly with anger. He booms something in Huttese at the Devaronian (“<em><strong>What is the meaning of bringing outsiders here?</strong></em>”), who immediately begins groveling, begging for the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> forgiveness as the rest of the court hoots with laughter and derision. <strong>Darga </strong>cuts him off with a harsh word (“<em><strong>Silence!</strong></em>”) and calls for his protocol droid, <strong>TC-663</strong>. From this point on, <strong>Darga </strong>begins addressing the heroes directly, using<strong> TC-663</strong> as a translator.</p>\n<p><strong>Darga’s </strong>giant eyes rest on them all for a long moment before the <strong>Hutt</strong> demands to know why they have come to his <strong>palace </strong>and how they convinced <strong>Raden</strong> to escort them. <strong>Darga </strong>is satisfied with any answer that is not confrontational. He really isn’t looking for trouble with the heroes; he just wants to feel them out and see if they could be useful in some way. He’s already impressed with their ability to locate his hidden <strong>palace </strong>(though it may not seem like much of a feat, there are many in <strong>Darga’s </strong>own organization who couldn’t manage it) and wants to discover whether they have any skills that he could exploit.</p>\n<p><strong>Darga </strong>begins this encounter <strong>indifferent</strong> to the heroes. If they can shift his attitude to <strong>friendly</strong> through a <strong>DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) </strong>or<strong> Charisma (Deception) check</strong>, he welcomes them into his court. Any flattery grants the heroes <strong>Advantage </strong>on <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) checks</strong> to alter the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> attitude, as do bribes or gifts of any kind. If the heroes mention that they are seeking employment or are interested in providing their services, they gain <strong>Advantage</strong> on <strong>Charisma (Deception) checks</strong> against the crime lord. <strong>Darga </strong>is still building up his power base and is always on the lookout for potentially valuable members of his organization. If the heroes fail their <strong>Persuasion check</strong> to join the court, they can still join by offering bribes or other incentives, though <strong>Darga </strong>expects at least <strong>1,000 credits’</strong> worth before he even considers it.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes have satisfied his curiosity, <strong>Darga </strong>invites them to join him at court for a short while. He has many matters to attend to over the next <strong>few days</strong>, and he is expecting visitors besides, but he is more than happy to let them stick around. <strong>Darga </strong>plans to impress the heroes with his wealth and power, hoping to convince them that a business relationship would be profitable. This is exactly the kind of thing the heroes need to get close to the <strong>Hutt</strong> and snoop around. If the heroes agree to remain at the <strong>palace</strong>, <strong>Darga</strong> calls for a feast and offers them a large amount of delicious (and expensive) food and drink. As the feast begins, two of <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> drag <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> off to the dungeons so that he can “<em><strong>think about his betrayal.</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>During the feast, <strong>Darga </strong>asks many questions about the heroes: who they are, where they come from, what their exploits are, and so on. He also gives them a chance to ask questions, but he graciously deflects any questions about his business practices for now. He lets one thing slip, however—if the heroes mention the Empire, <strong>Darga </strong>boasts that one of the visitors he is expecting is an <strong>Imperial agent</strong>. The <strong>Hutt</strong> seems to think that this will impress the heroes, though he reveals little more than the fact that the Empire is sending a delegate to his court sometime in the next <strong>few days</strong>.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the meal, the heroes get the impression that, while <strong>Darga </strong>is trying to win them over with his opulence, he is also testing to see whether they have anything to offer him. He drops hints with remarks such as, “<em><strong>We will see how you enjoy your time in my court—and how much I enjoy your company,</strong></em>” or “<em><strong>The next few days will give us a chance to get to know each other and see how much I have to offer you—and you to offer me!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note:</strong> gaining entry to <strong>Darga</strong> <strong>the Hutt's</strong> <strong>Palace </strong>should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Members of Darga the Hutt’s Court: At least twelve Gamorrean guards</strong>,<strong> three bounty hunters</strong>, <strong>three Quarren assassins,</strong> <strong>TC-663</strong> (Also called <strong>Six-Six</strong>),<strong> Igren Demos</strong> and other assorted beings. Full statistics blocks for some of these characters appear in the following encounters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[tE0urkjMN4ltuEr8]{Darga The Hutt}</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Encouraging the Heroes</strong></p>\n<p>During the scenes in Darga’s court, you should encourage the heroes to get involved in the various encounters by reminding them of their mission. When they enter the palace, they know very little about the Hutt’s involvement with the Sarlacc Project, and they should be eager to follow up on most leads. Encourage the heroes to take any opportunity to impress Darga, reminding them that gaining the crime lord’s trust might help them discover the truth behind his involvement in the Imperial plot. If you’re having trouble motivating the heroes to participate in the encounters, you might even go so far as to state that each encounter increases their chances of earning the crime lord’s favor (though you shouldn’t provide specific details).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Currying Darga's Favor</h2>\n<p>For the next <strong>few days</strong>, the heroes spend time in <strong>Darga’s court</strong>, learning about the <strong>Hutt</strong> and his dealings by observing, participating in encounters, and snooping around. (Knowing that an agent of the Empire will be arriving should give them further incentive to stick around.) Though <strong>Darga </strong>seems eager to show them a good time, he remains wary of outsiders, so he plans to keep the heroes close. As such, they must not only uncover the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> involvement with the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> but also ingratiate themselves with <strong>Darga</strong> to gain his confidence.</p>\n<p>Five major <strong>events</strong> occur during the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s court</strong>, each of which can affect how the crime lord feels about them. Each <strong>event</strong> is considered a noncombat encounter that gives the heroes a chance to showcase their ingenuity and skills (though combat may well break out at any time). Each <strong>event</strong> has a <strong>primary challenge</strong> and one or more <strong>secondary challenges.</strong> To win the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> favor, the heroes must succeed in the <strong>primary challenge</strong> of at least <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>five events.</strong> If they do so, the heroes gain <strong>XP</strong> as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 6</strong> challenge. Additionally, they gain <strong>Advantage </strong>when making<strong> skill checks</strong> against <strong>Darga</strong> or any member of his organization except <strong>Igren Demos</strong>. Finally, the <strong>Hutt</strong> has <strong>TC-663</strong> distribute <em>datacards</em> to the heroes that grant them access to a secret entrance to the guest quarters. These <em>datacards</em> might come in handy when they find the comatose Jedi hidden in the dungeon (see “<strong>Discovering Denia</strong>,” below).</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not succeed in the <strong>primary challenge</strong> of at least <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>five events,</strong> they still can learn what they need to know, but it will be more difficult.</p>\n<p>Treat each of the <strong>five events</strong> like an <strong>encounter.</strong> You won’t need to use <strong>Initiative</strong> unless <strong>combat</strong> breaks out, but once an event starts, treat the entire <strong>event</strong> like a single <strong>encounter</strong> for the purposes of per <strong>encounter resources,</strong> such as items or class features. If the heroes succeed in a specific <strong>event’s</strong> challenge, they gain <strong>XP</strong> as if they had defeated a <strong>CR</strong> <strong>6 </strong>challenge. If an event turns to combat (particularly <strong>Event 2: Gladiators</strong>), the heroes instead gain <strong>XP</strong> as normal for defeating enemies in battle. Keep in mind that engaging in combat during some of the events could cause the heroes to fail to overcome the associated <strong>challenges.</strong></p>\n<p>These <strong>events</strong> are designed to be spread out and run in nearly any order, allowing you to decide when to use them. As a general rule, the events should occur over at least <strong>two days</strong> (to allow <strong>Master Denia</strong> to make contact with the heroes during the night), and perhaps more depending on the flow of the game. Though most of the events can be run in any sequence, the event with the Imperial agents should be last, since it is likely the heroes’ main reason for staying in the <strong>palace</strong>. Additionally, several encounters from “<em><strong>Exploring Darga’s Palac</strong></em><strong>e</strong>” (page 13) work best when used to break up the action between the five events or when used during time spent away from <strong>Darga’s court</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Joining Darga</strong></p>\n<p>There is always a chance that one or more of the heroes truly will want to join Darga’s organization, and that’s fine—it might present a few complications, but it will also offer good story opportunities. As the adventure progresses, heroes who want to join the Hutt will probably be very eager to curry his favor, but they should also learn that Darga’s hold on his criminal empire is tenuous at best. By the end of <em>A Wretched Hive ,</em> when the Hutt flees to Cloud City on Bespin, the heroes should have an inkling that they could seize control of Darga’s organization for themselves. Indeed, that becomes a very real possibility when Darga meets his untimely demise in the next adventure, The Queen of Air and Darkness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Event 1: The Execution of Warrick Raden</h2>\n<p>By this time, it’s no secret that <strong>Darga</strong> is displeased with <strong>Warrick</strong> <strong>Raden </strong>for leading the heroes to him. True, the <strong>Hutt</strong> is interested in the heroes now that they’re here, but he doesn’t want <strong>Raden </strong>bringing just anyone to his secret <strong>palace</strong>, and he wants to make an example of the Devaronian. <strong>Darga </strong>has the errand boy dragged before his court and makes a declaration: <strong>Raden </strong>is to be executed, and since the heroes are new, they will perform the execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> The Hutt wants to show his court that those who betray him to outsiders will be punished severely. Additionally, he sees an opportunity to test the heroes’ mettle by seeing if they truly are willing to do his dirty work. Two <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> dump <strong>Raden </strong>unceremoniously in the open floor before the dais, and one of them holds out a <em>vibro-ax</em> for the heroes to use in the execution.</p>\n<p>The heroes’ <strong>primary challenge</strong> is to satisfy <strong>Darga’s </strong>need to punish <strong>Raden</strong> while proving their worthiness to be in his court. Of course, they can simply perform the execution—<strong>Raden </strong>is clearly a degenerate criminal, and the heroes might be tempted to remove such a person from the galaxy—which will satisfy <strong>Darga </strong>on all fronts. However, the killing would certainly be a <strong>Dark Side</strong> act, since <strong>Raden </strong>is helpless and at their mercy.</p>\n<p>If the heroes suggest an alternative fate for <strong>Raden</strong>, <strong>Darga</strong> is willing to listen, particularly if their idea involves violence. If they propose setting <strong>Raden </strong>up in some kind of fight, <strong>Darga</strong> is very agreeable and will include the Devaronian as one of the combatants in a gladiator match (see below).</p>\n<p>If the heroes outright refuse to take part in <strong>Raden’s </strong>punishment without attempting to be diplomatic about it, they automatically fail to overcome the <strong>primary challenge.</strong> <strong>Darga</strong> sees them as weak and unwilling to do his bidding.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the heroes can make <strong>Darga</strong> think that they killed <strong>Raden</strong>, he will likely fall for it. Knocking <strong>Raden </strong>unconscious will help, though the heroes should take care that <strong>Darga</strong> doesn’t look too closely at the Devaronian’s <em><strong>“corpse”</strong></em> or he might figure out their ruse. The heroes can make a <strong>Charisma (Deception) check</strong> against <strong>Darga’s Wisdom (Insight)</strong>, and each character who contributes to the ruse can improve the group’s chance of success. If the heroes fail to convince <strong>Darga </strong>that they have killed <strong>Raden</strong>, he is disappointed but takes no actions against them, and he orders one of his <strong>Quarren assassins</strong> to do the job instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> This event presents an opportunity for the heroes to learn more about<strong> Igren Demos</strong>, <strong>Darga’s </strong>Neimoidian majordomo. <strong>Demos </strong>is far more than the simpering sycophant that he appears to be. Any hero who succeeds on a <strong>Wisdom (Insight) check </strong>against <strong>Igren Demos' Charisma (Deception)</strong> can tell that the Neimoidian watches them very closely during the event. For the most part, <strong>Demos </strong>is just studying the heroes, though he seems to linger his attentions longer on any characters who are <strong>Force </strong>sensitive—as if he senses a kindred spirit. Any hero who is <strong>Force </strong>sensitive can make a <strong>DC 13 Wisdom</strong> or <strong>Charisma check</strong> with proficiency if they are proficient in <strong>Insight</strong>, if they succeed they can determine that <strong>Demos </strong>is indeed <strong>Force </strong>sensitive, though if approached, he denies it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> The conversion isn't clear on what they mean by \"Force sensitive,\" and one might note that we bolded Force, and not sensitive so as not to indicate a specific game mechanic (such as the feat.) It's up to the GM to determine what it means to be Force sensitive in their game. Is it only Forceusers? Is it people with the feat? Is it a conversation a GM and player have at the beginning of every character's career, that might or might not pan out during the evolving story? We suggest <em>you</em> decide the meaning of \"Force sensitive,\" in the context of this event, as it best pertains to your game.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Event 2: Gladiatory</h2>\n<p><strong>Darga</strong>, like all Hutts, has a short attention span and demands entertainment, usually of the more sadistic sort. The balcony overlooking the darkened area to the rear of <strong>Darga’s throne room is</strong> actually his viewing box for a moderately sized gladiator arena. From the looks of it, the arena was once a garden of some kind, likely filled with rare plants cultivated for a wealthy Neimoidian noble. The ceiling appears to be made entirely of transparisteel, though it has been crudely painted over, and gaudy lamps have been set in the walls all the way around the perimeter of the arena.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Darga’s</strong> command, the lights go up, and the heroes are invited to the viewing box for gladiator matches. <strong>Darga </strong>explains that he always enters a team of gladiators in an annual competition on <strong>Rattatak,</strong> and that over the <strong>course of the year</strong>, various teams challenge one another for the right to be <strong>Darga’s </strong>sponsored gladiators. After a few brutal matches during which several combatants are maimed or killed, <strong>Darga </strong>offers the heroes a chance to prove their own mettle in the combat arena.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> This is another chance for the heroes to curry <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor, this time by besting his current crop of champions. If the heroes express any concerns about participating, particularly if they feign concern for injuring <strong>Darga’s </strong>prized gladiators, the <strong>Hutt</strong> agrees to let the heroes fight with their weapons set on <strong>stun,</strong> promising that his gladiators will do the same. However, any match with weapons set on <strong>stun</strong> is destined to spiral out of control because the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> gladiators won’t take kindly to being defeated by newcomers and will switch their weapons back to lethal mode.</p>\n<p>If the heroes manage to defeat the opposing gladiators, they succeed in overcoming the <strong>primary challenge.</strong> If they choose not to take part in the match, they fail to impress <strong>Darga</strong>, who makes snide comments about their delicate sensibilities. However, if they present a reasonable alternative—such as offering to pay for half of the gladiator team’s <strong>sponsorship fee,</strong> or calling in favors on <strong>Rattatak</strong> to ensure an <strong>advantage</strong> for <strong>Darga’s </strong>team—they can still gain the Hutt’s favor.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> The heroes can earn a few <strong>credits</strong> by placing wagers on the gladiator matches that precede their own. <strong>Darga </strong>is more than happy to place bets with the heroes. Use the <strong>@JournalEntry[CjvJcbNvGLnJ5JCX]{Gambling} activity</strong> in <em><strong>Wretched Hives's</strong></em> <strong>Downtime</strong> section with the uptime verson's ruleset.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>goes on at length about how tough his gladiators are, and how he selects only the best for the games on Rattatak. He even mentions how his sponsorship earns the gladiators the finest weapons and armor that money can buy, again hoping to entice the heroes to enter the arena. If any of the heroes has displayed an aptitude for machinery or mentioned a penchant for technology, <strong>Darga </strong>makes a few circumspect inquiries as to the availability of that hero’s skills. Any character with proficiency in Armstech Tools who offers to upgrade a few weapons for <strong>Darga’s gladiators</strong> immediately earns the Hutt’s favor. Such a character may also grant themselves <strong>Advantage </strong>on a <strong>skill check </strong>made during interactions with <strong>Darga</strong>.</p>\n<p>Gladiator Match</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[Sm7SseN7GvTtyP7P]{2-03 Gladiator Match}</strong></p>\n<h2>Event 3: The Slavers</h2>\n<p><strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> has many contacts on many worlds, but few are as unsavory as a band of slavers known as the <strong>Iron Ring.</strong> These slavers are small-time—at least, compared to some of the more dangerous slaving rings in the galaxy—but what they lack in influence, they make up for in zeal. Most of the <strong>Iron Ring’s</strong> jurisdiction is on former Confederate worlds ravaged by the Clone Wars, where the Empire’s influence is minimal. <strong>Cato Neimoidia </strong>is one of their many planets of operation.</p>\n<p>A delegation from the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> comes to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> during the heroes’ stay there, and the <strong>slavers</strong> are not happy. The delegation consists of three tough-looking Humans, a Rodian with a large <em>blaster rifle,</em> a black-furred Wookiee, and a scarred Zabrak leading two Twi’lek <strong>slaves</strong> by their collars. They arrive seemingly unannounced, and as the <strong>audience chamber</strong> falls silent, it becomes apparent that <strong>Darga </strong>is less than pleased to see them. Taking up space in the middle of the chamber, the <strong>slavers</strong> offer everyone in the room, including the Hutt, a hard glare. After <strong>Darga </strong>spurts out a question in Huttese (“<em><strong>What are you doing here?</strong></em>”), the Zabrak steps forward and spits on the floor before speaking in heavily accented Basic. Read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“The slaves you have been selling us are worthless, Darga! They have been dying before we can even get them to market. They are used up—second-rate! I want my credits back for the last four shipments!”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Darga</strong> lets out a low, rumbling laugh that sounds sinister even for the gluttonous Hutt. He rolls his eyes toward the heroes, utters a side remark (“<em><strong>See what ungrateful business partners I have?</strong></em>”) and then gives the <strong>slavers</strong> an angry response, translated by his protocol droid. The crime lord tells them that they have had the same business agreement <strong>for years now</strong> and that he is not responsible if they don’t know how to take care of their own product. He says that if they do not apologize and leave, he will have no choice but to dispose of them. The <strong>Hutt</strong> seems unconcerned that they are all heavily armed because he believes that the <strong>slavers</strong> are just trying to talk tough and wouldn’t dare attempt to harm him.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> At this point, the <strong>slavers</strong> and the <strong>Hutt</strong> descend into a seemingly fruitless argument about <strong>slaves</strong> and payment, with neither side budging. In truth, <strong>Darga </strong>could appease the <strong>slavers</strong> easily, since he actually pays nothing for the <strong>slaves</strong> he passes on. However, he is stalling the delegation, waiting to see if the heroes will intervene on his behalf.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do nothing, <strong>Darga </strong>eventually turns a disappointed eye on them before granting the <strong>slavers</strong> their wish. Similarly, if the heroes intervene on the <strong>slavers’</strong> behalf, <strong>Darga </strong>grumbles about his guests not knowing when to keep their mouths shut, but again he acquiesces to the <strong>slavers’</strong> demands. In both of these cases, the <strong>Hutt</strong> grudgingly invites the <strong>slavers</strong> to remain for a time in his court.</p>\n<p>If the heroes intervene on the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> behalf, they can impress <strong>Darga </strong>by convincing the <strong>slavers</strong> not only to withdraw their request but also to continue buying <strong>slaves</strong> from the <strong>Hutt.</strong> The Zabrak leader begins the encounter <strong>unfriendly</strong> toward the heroes. Shifting his attitude to indifference through a<strong> DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) </strong>will earn the heroes a chance to convince him to keep his business with <strong>Darga</strong>. Unfortunately, the <strong>slavers</strong> are correct—<strong>Darga </strong>has been selling them <strong>slaves</strong> who have very little life left, and they have every right to be upset. Convincing them to continue buying from the <strong>Hutt</strong> is no easy task, and the heroes will need to present a solution that is beneficial for the <strong>slavers.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes present a reasonable solution to the negotiations, they gain <strong>Advantage</strong> on <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) checks</strong> to convince the <strong>slavers</strong> to keep their bargain with <strong>Darga</strong>. If the heroes succeed on a <strong>DC 20 Persuasion check</strong>, they convince the <strong>Zabrak</strong> to accept the deal, and they earn <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor for this challenge</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> During the discussion, the heroes might notice that one of the delegation’s Twi’lek <strong>slaves</strong> is more than she appears. As a servant enters the throne room with a large goblet of wine for the crime lord, the heroes can make a contested <strong>Wisdom (Perception) </strong>versus the Twi'lek's<strong> Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</strong>, the Twi'lek slave has a <strong>+7</strong> to this roll <strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong><strong>(</strong></strong>[[/r 1d20+7 # Sleight of Hand]])</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">. If they succeed, </span>the heroes notice the Twi’lek  <strong>slave </strong>surreptitiously dropping a powdery substance into the goblet as she passes by. The substance, of course, is <strong>poison.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes stop <strong>Darga </strong>from drinking the <strong>poison,</strong> they immediately succeed on the <strong>primary challenge.</strong> Furthermore, if they reveal the Twi’lek’s guilt, <strong>Darga </strong>becomes enraged and threatens to throw the <strong>slavers</strong> in the dungeons. The Zabrak leader immediately withdraws his request for a new deal and apologizes profusely. Though he convinces <strong>Darga </strong>that the <strong>slave</strong> was acting of her own accord, the <strong>Hutt</strong> remains furious and declares the discussion over. The <strong>slavers</strong> beat a hasty retreat, except for the Wookiee, who secretly remains in the <strong>palace</strong> for a later encounter (see “<strong>@JournalEntry[YlpCNpJ2GNchsZn1]{2-05 A Knife in the Dark}</strong>\")</p>\n<p>If the heroes fail to notice the <strong>poison</strong> being slipped in <strong>Darga’s </strong>drink, the <strong>Hutt</strong> drinks it down and becomes ill. The <strong>poison</strong> isn’t strong enough to kill him, but it does sicken him—the slavers were hoping to gain an <strong>advantage</strong> in their negotiations. <strong>Darga </strong>declares an end to the day’s audience and retires to his personal chambers, though the heroes take no <strong>penalties</strong> and the event resumes the <strong>following day</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Event 4: Droid Racing</h2>\n<p>All work and no play makes <strong>Darga </strong>a dull Hutt—a motto the crime lord firmly stands by—and at a certain point, he calls for some diversion. One of <strong>Darga’s </strong>favorite activities is <strong>droid racing,</strong> wherein several members of his court compete for his favor while controlling droids in a race around the gladiator arena. <strong>Some years ago</strong>, a smuggling ship in <strong>Darga’s </strong>employ returned from the edges of the Unknown Regions with advanced droid interface technology. Instead of turning the technology over to scientists, <strong>Darga </strong>had his own technicians use it to create toys for his amusement. The result is a set of <strong>racing droids,</strong> each of which can be controlled remotely by donning a visor that allows the pilot to “see” out of the droid’s electronic eyes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the <strong>droid interfaces</strong> have some drawbacks. They are notoriously difficult to control and require intense focus and mental acuity to get any kind of result. Worse, in some cases, major damage to one of the racing droids has produced dangerous sensory feedback that has nearly <strong>scrambled the minds</strong> of the pilots. Despite this, <strong>Darga</strong> insists that members of his court take turns piloting the droids. He rewards the victor handsomely and makes no secret of his delight when a droid is wrecked and the pilot’s mind damaged.</p>\n<p>The races take place in <strong>Darga’s gladiator arena</strong>; barricades are set up to create a winding track that doubles back on itself to form a large, bending course. Within the course, artificial ramps and pits make it all the more likely that a racing droid will crash. As the course is being set up, <strong>Darga </strong>invites one of the heroes to pilot his personal racing droid. When pressed, <strong>Darga </strong>reveals that his last pilot<strong> has yet to recover</strong> from an injury he sustained during the race (“<em><strong>But you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Ho, ho, ho, ho!</strong></em>”). He promises a reward to the winner, and three more members of his court come forward to try their hand at a racing droid: one of the <strong>Quarren,</strong> a <strong>Gamorrean guard,</strong> and the Neimoidian majordomo <strong>Igren Demos</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> At this point, one of the heroes has a chance to pilot a <strong>racing droid.</strong> Each of the droids seems fragile, and <strong>Darga </strong>allows the hero who volunteers some time to get acquainted with the interface. During this time, the other members of the party might be able to provide assistance through <strong>Secondary Challenges.</strong> The droid is piloted through a simple system of visual commands, but managing those commands while keeping an eye on the track is challenging.</p>\n<p>The race consists of three laps around the track. For each lap, each pilot makes an <strong>Intelligence check</strong>. The highest result earns <strong>4 speed points</strong>, the second highest earns <strong>3 speed points</strong>, the next highest earns <strong>2 speed points</strong>, and the lowest earns a <strong>single speed point</strong>. Additionally, a roll of a <strong>natural 1 </strong>on the<strong> Intelligence check</strong> automatically comes in last place, causing the pilot to <strong>lose 1 speed point</strong>. At the end of the race (after <strong>three Intelligence checks</strong>), the pilot with the highest number of <strong>speed points </strong>wins the race.</p>\n<p>However, no underground race would be complete without a few dirty tricks. Once per lap, any pilot can make his droid <strong>attack </strong>another racing droid. To do this, the pilot declares that his droid tries to <strong>attack </strong>another droid and wagers <strong>1 </strong>to <strong>4 speed points</strong>. The pilot can wager more <strong>speed points</strong> than he currently owns, but failure has its consequences. The pilot then makes an<strong> attack roll</strong> for his droid (<strong>1d20 + the number of speed points wagered</strong>) against an <strong>AC</strong> of <strong>13</strong>. Success indicates that the target droid is <strong>damaged </strong>by the <strong>attack</strong>; the <strong>attacking </strong>pilot gains a number of <strong>speed points</strong> equal to the number wagered, while the defending pilot loses that same number of speed points. Failure indicates that the <strong>attacker </strong>loses the number of speed points wagered. Regardless of whether the <strong>attack </strong>succeeds or fails, the <strong>attacking </strong>pilot earns<strong> 1 less speed point</strong> on his next lap.</p>\n<p>Any racing droid that has fewer than <strong>0 speed points</strong> crashes and is destroyed. The control visor overloads, make the pilot roll a <strong>DC 15 constitution saving throw </strong>with a failed <strong>save </strong>giving <strong>1 level of @Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>. If the <strong>“Hidden Enemies”</strong> or “<strong>Discovering Denia</strong>” encounters (see below) happen<strong> later the same day</strong>, the race might be a chance for the piloting hero to impose a level of exhaustion on the Quarren assassins or <strong>Igren Demos</strong>. That would give the heroes a small advantage when dealing with those opponents in the later encounter.</p>\n<p>The winner of the race receives a gaudy necklace valued at about <strong>500 credits.</strong> In truth, a hero who enters the race does not actually need to win to curry <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor; participation is enough to gain the Hutt’s approval. If the heroes refuse to participate, the race proceeds without them, and <strong>Igren Demos</strong> wins handily. <strong>Darga </strong>is not impressed with the heroes, remarking on their timidity, but it does not hurt their chances in other events.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge: </strong>Before the droid race starts, the heroes can study the technology that makes the race possible: the control visor. Any hero who makes a successful <strong>Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> can examine the visor and learn something about how it works. The information learned depends on the <strong>DC</strong> of the <strong>check</strong>, as shown below. Note that <strong>DCs</strong> higher than <strong>15 </strong>are considered expert knowledge, and thus only a character proficient in <strong>Intelligence (Technology) </strong>can obtain that information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DC 10: </strong>The droid control visor reads the eye movements of the user and translates them into commands, while simultaneously providing an in-droid view of the action. A successful <strong>Intelligence check </strong>is necessary to control the droid.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 15: </strong>The control visor is a bit unstable and could damage the user under some circumstances. During catastrophic failures, the wearer has to make a <strong>constitution saving throw</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 20:</strong> The control visor’s software is full of errors, indicating that it is probably a prototype. A successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology)</strong> can smooth out some of the programming bugs, allowing the wearer to add their <strong>proficiency bonus </strong>to <strong>Intelligence checks</strong> to <strong>pilot</strong> the <strong>racing droids.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>DC 25:</strong> The problem with the control visor’s interface is that it was designed for a non-Human species. A successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check </strong>can alter the visor to better accommodate humanoid species, reducing the visor’s <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong> to <strong>DC 10</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge: </strong>The heroes can earn a few credits by placing wagers on the droid race. <strong>Darga </strong>is more than happy to place bets with the heroes. Use the<strong> @JournalEntry[CjvJcbNvGLnJ5JCX]{Gambling} activity</strong> in <em><strong>Wretched Hives's </strong></em><strong>Downtime </strong>section with the uptime verson's ruleset.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> Any character who examines the droid control visor can tell that the technology is fairly sophisticated and that its ability to translate the pilot’s commands is uncanny. During the race, allow this character to make a <strong>DC 13 Perception check </strong>to notice <strong>TC-663</strong>, the Hutt’s droid translator, during the race. Each time a <strong>droid</strong> slams into a wall or is smashed by another droid, <strong>TC-663</strong> seems to flinch a bit. If a hero approaches him and inquires about the flinching, he explains that the <strong>racing droids</strong> are not merely remotely controlled shells, but actual <strong>droids</strong> with intelligence and awareness, much like himself. <strong>TC-663</strong> thinks it is barbaric that the control visors are used to directly usurp the <strong>racing droids’</strong> self-aware functions. If the hero shows any sympathy, that character gains <strong>Advantage</strong> on all <strong>skill checks</strong> made on <strong>TC-663</strong> from this point forward. This benefit might come into play later, when <strong>TC-663</strong> approaches the heroes with a message from <strong>Switch.</strong></p>\n<h2>Final Event: Imperial Visitor</h2>\n<p>The final event of the heroes’ visit to the court is the arrival of an Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> who comes to discuss the resources being transferred through <strong>Darga’s </strong>slimy hands on behalf of the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> This is probably the event that the heroes have been waiting for, since it is their best chance to learn more about the secret project.</p>\n<p>When this event begins, three people are ushered into <strong>Darga’s </strong>audience chamber: two men and one woman. Though none of them is wearing any kind of Imperial uniform, whispers of “<em><strong>Imperial agents</strong></em>” ripple through the court. The two men are dressed in basic laborer’s clothing, and their eyes scan the room as if they expect an attack at any moment. The woman is also simply dressed, but it is clear from her bearing that she considers herself well above this assignment.</p>\n<p>Allow any of the heroes present to make a <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong>. Success indicates that they notice that each of the men carries an identical <em>blaster carbine,</em> and in fact the two men could be twins, other than a few small differences, such as the placement of scars. The two men are actually <strong>stormtroopers</strong> who have removed their armor; each is one of the few remaining clones of <strong>Jango Fett</strong> left over from the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> Before the Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> arrives, <strong>Darga </strong>summons the heroes close and quietly explains that he expects the Empire to try to double-cross him. Deals with the Empire have great potential rewards, he says, but one must always be careful when negotiating with such powerful allies. He implores the heroes to watch the proceedings and help him retain the upper hand in negotiations.</p>\n<p>If the heroes agree, the <strong>Hutt</strong> is very pleased, and he asks them to wait off to one side while he deals with the Imperial agent. When she arrives, flanked by her two guards, <strong>Darga</strong> rolls his eyes meaningfully in the heroes’ direction and then greets the newcomers (“Always a pleasure to serve the Empire! What can I do for you today?”). Neither the agent nor her guards seem to notice the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> glance toward the heroes.</p>\n<p>The Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> wastes no time and launches into a spiel about the transfer of Tibanna gas from <strong>Darga’s </strong>holdings to the Empire. She insists that while <strong>Darga’s </strong>supplies have been sufficient thus far, the Empire needs him to step up his production of refined <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> immediately. As the heroes should come to understand, <strong>Darga </strong>has been shipping the gas (which is used in producing <em>blaster</em> and <em>turbolaser</em> bolts) to the Empire in substantial quantities, and now they want more . The <strong>liaison</strong> offers the <strong>Hutt</strong> an <strong>80% increase</strong> in payments for a <strong>100% increase</strong> in output, claiming that it is more than fair since he will be making more money overall.</p>\n<p>Additionally, she makes two other propositions. First, the Empire is willing to offer a further <strong>20% increase</strong> in payments if the <strong>Hutt</strong> accepts the increase in <strong><em>“biological”</em></strong> resources. Though she really means <strong>slaves,</strong> she does not come out and say so, and the heroes might not connect this statement with the complaints of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> slavers. (It’s fine if they don’t; the full extent of the sordid deal will be exposed in the next adventure, <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>.)</p>\n<p>Second, the <strong>liaison</strong> offers to provide <strong>Darga</strong> with a personal Imperial security retinue as a sign of their continued good faith. The <strong>Hutt</strong> would have an Imperial regiment stationed in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and a flight of Imperial starfighters would escort him when traveling off-world.</p>\n<p>At this point, <strong>Darga </strong>turns to the heroes for advice. If the heroes have not set up a private method of communicating with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>dismisses the Imperials temporarily so they won’t overhear the discussion. If the heroes provide him with the advice he wants to hear, they can earn his favor. Of the three proposals, <strong>Darga </strong>believes that the first one is sound (more money coming in at only a slight discount) and the latter two are not. The <strong>slaves</strong> he has been getting from the Empire are used up, and payments in credits are more reliable in the long run. Additionally, the promised security retinue seems like little more than a plot to expand Imperial influence on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> and keep the <strong>Hutt</strong> under the Imperial Security Bureau’s watchful eye.</p>\n<p>If the heroes make the correct recommendation <em><strong>(“yes”</strong></em> on the increased production, <em><strong>“no”</strong></em> on the increased payment in biological resources, and <em><strong>“no”</strong></em> on the Imperial retinue) for two out of the three options, <strong>Darga </strong>is suitably impressed by their keen minds, and they will have gained more favor with the crime lord.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> As the encounter with the Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> goes on, grant a <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong> to any heroes who were in the company of <strong>Bail Organa</strong> before the trip to <strong>Felucia </strong>in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>. Success indicates that the heroes recognize the <strong>liaison</strong> as someone they spotted in the halls of <strong>Organa’s palace</strong> on <strong>Alderaan</strong>. (Alternatively, if the heroes did not play <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, they might recognize the <strong>liaison</strong> as one of the crewmembers of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>.)</p>\n<p>In truth, the <strong>liaison</strong> is a double agent who secretly works for the Imperial Security Bureau. Her real name is <strong>Victra Sinde,</strong> though the name she uses when posing as a member of <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> security force is <strong>Alysa.</strong> She has been spying on <strong>Organa</strong> for several months now, though she has been unable to uncover hard evidence of his involvement in treasonous activities. She was called away from her assignment to assist the Empire in continuing their arrangement with <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, and she was not expecting to run into anyone who might recognize her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes confront <strong>Sinde,</strong> she denies any involvement with <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. If the heroes continue to make accusations, she threatens them with immediate arrest. Mentally, she notes the faces (and names, if possible) of the heroes and vows to ensure that the Empire becomes aware of their activities. If the heroes allow <strong>Sinde</strong> to leave after such an exchange, she might become a thorn in their side down the road, particularly if they journey to worlds under tight Imperial control, such as <strong>Coruscant</strong> or <strong>Nizon.</strong> Though such repercussions are beyond the scope of this adventure, feel free to have <strong>Sinde</strong> show up later.</p>\n<p>Informing <strong>Bail Organa</strong> that he has a double agent in his midst certainly causes an uproar on <strong>Alderaan</strong>. If this occurs, <strong>Sinde</strong> does not return to <strong>Organa’s </strong>service, having learned ahead of time that her cover has been blown, and <strong>Organa </strong>is grateful for the heroes’ efforts.</p>\n<h3>Counseling Darga</h3>\n<p>The heroes might be unsure of how to provide <strong>Darga </strong>with counsel during the encounter with the Imperial <strong>liaison,</strong> and they might look to their skills as a means of determining the correct course of action. Though you should be careful not to give away the right answers with simple <strong>skill checks</strong>, you can steer the heroes in the right direction. For example, a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> can reveal that the Empire has made offers of security retinues to nobles and powerful administrators in the past, most of the time on worlds where Imperial forces were particularly thin. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> can tell the heroes that biological resources of any kind are notoriously unstable, and rarity is one of the only things that can drive their value up. Lastly, a successful<strong> DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check </strong>can tell the heroes that Imperial contracts are almost always spread very thin, and that the Empire rarely offers substantial contract increases to individuals.</p>\n<h2>Exploring Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>Since the events above are likely to take place over the <strong>course of several days</strong>, adventurous heroes might want to explore <strong>Darga’s palace </strong>between sessions in the court. Similarly, you might wish to encourage them to poke around so that they can learn valuable pieces of information. At the end of the<strong> first day </strong>in the <strong>palace</strong>, the Hutt gives each hero his or her own room in the guest quarters, which were actually the servants’ quarters when the building was owned by Neimoidian nobles. The rooms are surprisingly clean, though sparsely appointed, and Gamorrean guards casually patrol the halls during the evenings. The heroes have a few amenities at their disposal—servants bring food or drink to their quarters—and if they have done something to impress the Hutt during the day, he might send them evening gifts, such as fine foods, spice, or even entertainment (in various forms).</p>\n<p>Below are several encounters that can take place in any order during the time between events in <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>throne room.</strong></p>\n<h3>The Aviary</h3>\n<p>When the heroes arrived on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, they tangled with <strong>Kessra,</strong> the leader of the <strong>Vipers</strong> swoop gang. If they defeated her but left her alive, she follows the heroes to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> to exact her revenge upon them. During their audience with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> she hid and observed them from a distance, and at some point she decides to whittle them down a few at a time. Late one night, one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>servants (a <strong>Neimoidian </strong>who seems afraid of everything) visits the rooms of one or two heroes who are particularly charismatic or who had some kind of special interaction with <strong>Kessra</strong> during the swoop gang encounter. The servant tells the heroes that <strong>Darga </strong>has summoned them to a secret meeting in his <strong>aviary</strong> because he cannot trust anyone else with what he has to say. As far as the <strong>Neimoidian </strong>knows, this is correct. The message was relayed to him by <strong>Kessra,</strong> dressed as one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>dancing girls, who claimed to be passing the information on from the Hutt.</p>\n<p>The<strong> Neimoidian servant</strong> leads the heroes out of the guest quarters and to an upper level of the <strong>palace</strong>. Once there, he points to a set of sliding double doors and says that <strong>Darga </strong>waits inside. When the heroes pass through the doors, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The interior of the aviary is quiet, and rising up from either side of a winding path are numerous trees, each with many colorful birds sleeping while perched on their branches.

Gome</strong> has been working for the crime lord for decades now, ever since <strong>Darga</strong> first rose to power, and he is exceptionally good at his job. Unlike others who have benefited from <strong>Darga’s </strong>wealth, <strong>Gome</strong> is mostly indifferent about his work. He seems to have no emotional investment in <strong>Darga’s </strong>crime syndicate and is puzzled by the idea that someone might try to meddle in the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> resides in a small apartment just off of the guest quarters, which serves as both his home and his workspace. The Duros has little daily contact with anyone other than the servants who bring him food and drink, so when the heroes show up at his door, he is more than a bit surprised. (The heroes might be drawn to his apartment by the <strong>loud Neimoidian opera </strong>echoing from behind the door, or because they saw a <strong>Gamorrean guard</strong> from <strong>Darga’s court </strong>bring a transparent bag full of <em>credit sticks</em> to <strong>Gome’s</strong> room.)</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge: Gome</strong> presents a good opportunity for the heroes to learn more about <strong>Darga’s</strong> involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> particularly the nature of what he trades to the Empire. Though <strong>Gome</strong> is surprised to see the heroes, his attitude begins as <strong>indifferent</strong> toward them. If the heroes shift his attitude to friendly through a <strong>DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he is happy to discuss all manner of secrets with them—at least, the ones he knows about. <strong>Gome</strong> is older and probably nearing the end of his days, so he tends to ramble and get distracted. The heroes will need to keep him on track if they are to learn anything from him, so you should portray him as absent-minded to encourage the heroes to steer him back to their conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> knows the following: At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, <strong>Darga</strong> took over a Tibanna gas smuggling ring after its leader was slain by Separatist mercenaries. Since that time, he has managed to increase the amount of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> that is being smuggled away from its normal channels, and the smuggling ring has proven to be his most profitable venture, even ahead of his slave trading. The Empire approached <strong>Darga</strong> a few months ago with an interest in obtaining some of his <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> supplies off the record—though <strong>Gome</strong> recalls that they threatened to bring down the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> crime syndicate if he didn’t play nicely. Since then, <strong>Darga </strong>has been funneling every canister of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> to the Empire for a secret project. The gas, which is refined on the planet <strong>Bespin,</strong> is loaded into large starships and handed over to the Empire in the space above that world. In return, <strong>Darga </strong>receives some kind of goods <strong>(Gome</strong> does not know what), and their transaction is ended. The exchange takes place quickly and seems private because few people even know that Bespin exists; it’s too small to have an Imperial presence. <strong>Darga</strong> has made a handsome profit from the arrangement, and he maintains a remote headquarters in Cloud City, where he can personally oversee the transactions and enjoy the amenities of the floating city.</p>\n<h2>Hidden Enemies</h2>\n<p>Being guests of <strong>Darga the Hutt </strong>confers a small amount of protection on the heroes, but some would still rather see them eliminated than left alive to meddle further. During one of the nights that the heroes sleep in the guest quarters, a cadre of assassins tries to kill them.</p>\n<p>If any of the heroes previously revealed themselves to be <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive while in <strong>Darga’s court</strong>, the assassins are sent by<strong> Igren Demos</strong>. In this scenario, the majordomo fears that the heroes might expose his own <strong>Force </strong>sensitivity and wants to curtail any potential threat to his ascension to power. Sending a message through a lackey, he tricks <strong>Darga’s </strong>Quarren assassins into thinking the order to kill the heroes came from the Hutt. He also enlists the help of two members of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> slaver delegation—the Wookiee and the Twi’lek poisoner.</p>\n<p>If no hero revealed himself to be <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive, the assassins are sent by the <strong>slavers.</strong> In this scenario, the <strong>slavers</strong> want the heroes dead as punishment for interfering with their negotiations with <strong>Darga</strong>. The same group <strong>attacks </strong>the heroes—three <strong>Quarren,</strong> the <strong>Wookiee,</strong> and the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> poisoner. However, if the heroes discovered the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> attempting to poison <strong>Darga</strong>, she does not take part in this <strong>attack</strong>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">A Knife in the Dark</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[YlpCNpJ2GNchsZn1]{2-05 A Knife in the Dark}</strong></p>\n<h2>A Visit from Six-Six</h2>\n<p>One member of <strong>Darga’s court</strong> that the heroes have interacted with but might not have thought much about is the translating protocol droid, <strong>TC-663</strong>. Unremarkable during the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> thus far, <strong>TC-663</strong> is occasionally seen wandering the halls of the <strong>palace </strong>on one errand or another. At some point when the heroes are all together away from the Hutt’s court, the shiny silver droid approaches them and asks to speak with them in private.</p>\n<p>When he is certain they are alone,<strong> TC-663</strong> (who insists that the heroes call him <strong>Six-Six</strong>) explains that in addition to serving as the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> translator, he also serves another master—a droid crime lord named <strong>Switch,</strong> who lives on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> above the world of <strong>Brentaal.</strong> If the heroes played through <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, they have probably already encountered <strong>Switch</strong> and perhaps even offered to act as his agents in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six</strong> reveals that he has come to convey a small piece of information on <strong>Switch’s</strong> behalf. The droid tells the heroes that he has been monitoring communications leaving <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, and it seems that someone has been transmitting information to the Empire while the <strong>Hutt</strong> sleeps, receiving instructions in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six </strong>has been sending these messages on to <strong>Switch,</strong> but the droid crime lord has been unable to break their encryption. <strong>Switch</strong> has ordered<strong> Six-Six</strong> to turn the encrypted transmissions file over to the heroes and see what they can make of it. If the heroes are willing to share their findings with <strong>Six-Six</strong> (who will share them with <strong>Switch),</strong> they can have the file at no charge.</p>\n<p>Any hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> decrypts the file and retrieves the contents of the message. It reveals that late at night, the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> majordomo, <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, has been contacting an Imperial communications relay somewhere in the sector. The heroes cannot be certain who he is communicating with, but they know that <strong>Demos</strong> has been transmitting information about <strong>Darga’s </strong>dealings—particularly his slave trading—on a regular basis. The most recent communication specifically mentions that the slavers that <strong>Darga </strong>has been dealing with are unhappy with their merchandise. Additionally, several messages mention “<strong>the prisoner</strong>” but provide no further details.</p>\n<p>If confronted about his communications with the Empire, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> staunchly denies it. Presenting the decrypted file does not help because <strong>Demos </strong>claims that it must be a forgery, and <strong>Darga </strong>is inclined to agree with his trusted advisor. If the heroes remain adamant that the majordomo is doing something untoward even after <strong>Darga </strong>dismissed this claim, the <strong>Hutt</strong> might become upset. To represent his shifting attitudes, you might wish to treat a previous incident in which the heroes successfully curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor as a failure instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/sixsix_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"573\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YcEBkSk41K8jcfDK]{07 - Handout 7 - Six-Six}</p>\n<h2>Discovering Denia</h2>\n<p>One of the most critical events that happens during the heroes’ stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> is their discovery of a comatose Jedi Master named <strong>Denia</strong>. This event should occur only near the end of their stay in the <strong>palace</strong>, and most likely after the heroes have gone through the five events in <strong>Darga’s court </strong>(and perhaps obtained the <em>datacard</em> granting access to the guest quarters). Since the discovery of <strong>Denia </strong>will probably conclude the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, do not rush in introducing this event.</p>\n<p>During the Clone Wars, <strong>Denia </strong>was fighting on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong> when she was injured in an explosion. One of the Separatist generals had her unconscious form brought to this <strong>palace </strong>and placed in an artificial coma while they decided what to do with her. When the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end, the Separatists fled the <strong>palace </strong>and left the Jedi behind. <strong>Darga</strong> moved in soon after and discovered <strong>Denia’s </strong>comatose body. Never one to throw away a potential resource, <strong>Darga</strong> had her moved to the lowest levels of the <strong>palace </strong>and kept unconscious, thinking that there might come a day when she could prove useful. When the heroes arrived, <strong>Denia </strong>could sense their presence even while unconscious (either because one or more of the heroes is <strong>Force </strong>sensitive, or because destiny swirls about them), and she reaches out to them for help.</p>\n<p>This first becomes apparent when the heroes (particularly any <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes) start hearing whispers in their heads. If the heroes stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> after their time in his court, one or two of them begin to hear whispers in their sleep, so strongly that they awaken. If the heroes appear to be making plans to leave, you can have them hear the whispers while awake. The voice, clearly that of a woman, says things such as, <em><strong>“Help</strong> <strong>me,”</strong></em> and “<em><strong>I know you can hear me.”</strong></em> If the heroes attempt to ignore the whispers, the voice becomes more insistent, begging for help and pleading with them to find her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes search for a way to find the whispers, they discover that the voice becomes stronger if they descend through the guest quarters into the lower reaches of the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor and were given the <em>datacard</em> to access the secret way in and out of the guest quarters, they can also use it to access a turbolift to the lower levels of the guest quarters. The turbolift leads them directly to the chambers where <strong>Denia </strong>is being held.</p>\n<p>If the heroes never obtained the <em>datacard,</em> they can still reach <strong>Denia </strong>by finding a stairwell that leads down into the lower guest quarters. However, this path passes through an antechamber where some of <strong>Darga’s Gamorrean guards</strong> await. The guards tell the heroes to turn back, and if they refuse, a fight ensues.</p>\n<h2>Into the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PyhIV17Hc6Zo8A34]{2-06 Into the Dungeons}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>is being held in a dank, disgusting area directly beneath the guest quarters that resembles a dungeon. The chamber is in disrepair, and structural damage to the <strong>palace </strong>has allowed rainwater to leak in, giving the place a musty feel. If the heroes step out of the turbolift, they see a narrow hallway filled with pools of stagnant water, with cells off to the right. The whispers grow louder in their minds, urging them on and giving them directions to a large metal door.</p>\n<p>Pushing a button on the door causes it to creak and stutter as it slides open, revealing a chamber that resembles a dilapidated hospital room. It has the same musty smell as the outer hallway, but in this room is a large bed on which lays a woman well into her older years, connected to a variety of machines that seem to be monitoring her vital functions. A large tube of semitransparent liquid is connected to the woman intravenously, and her chest rises and falls slowly. Once inside the room, the whispers in the <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes’ minds become stronger, and the voice claims that she can feel them close to her. <strong>Denia </strong>telepathically begs the heroes to free her, though the limitations on her telepathy keep her from asking or answering any more questions</p>\n<p>Any hero can disconnect <strong>Denia </strong>from the machines that are keeping her in a coma. A hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check</strong> can bring her out of the coma gently, and she regains consciousness with <strong>4 levels of exhaustion</strong>. Otherwise, she regains consciousness with 5 levels of exhaustion and cannot move. This exhaustion cannot be removed until she receives extended medical treatment for at least a week (which she will be able to get aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> between adventures).</p>\n<p>When <strong>Denia </strong>has been brought out of her coma, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The eyes of the older woman on the bed flicker open and then seem glazed for a long moment before drawing into sharp focus.

She tells the heroes that she is a Jedi Master and that she was assigned to <strong>Plo Koon’s</strong> battle group here on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. She was engaged in a pitched battle against the Separatists when a droid starfighter crashed near her, sending her into blackness. When her mind had recovered from the damage done to her body, she found herself unable to awaken or to purge her system of the drugs that were keeping her in a coma. She has been trying to reach out for help, but the only visitor to her room has been someone who seems shrouded in darkness. She doesn’t know who this person is (in truth, it is <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, the majordomo) or why he or she enters the room, but she did not attempt to make contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>asks the heroes to help her escape, since she has clearly been held prisoner for a while. She has many questions for them and wants to learn what has happened since she was knocked unconscious. If the heroes tell her honestly what has transpired since the conclusion of the Clone Wars, she senses the truth of their words and seems disheartened, but she vows to press on and escape from the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes attempt to deceive her, <strong>Denia </strong>tries to sense their true motives (her Perception score is high, even when penalized, and she has a good chance to see through their ruses), but she plays along for the time being. She is eager to leave and has no desire to stay in these dungeons any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>The heroes probably have some questions for <strong>Denia</strong>. Below are some answers to common questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you know anything about Darga the Hutt or the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>No, I’ve been trapped here inside my own head for too long. I’m afraid those names mean absolutely nothing to me.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>You were a Jedi; how did you escape Order 66? </strong>“<em>It wouldn’t surprise me if I was thought to have been killed in battle. It’s likely that this... Empire doesn’t even know that I exist.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Can you help us get you out of here? </strong>“<em>I will do what I can. However, I can already feel panic rising above us. I’d say that by now, they know you’ve set me free.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Can you tell us anything more about the dark presence you sensed?</strong> “<em>Only that whoever it was seemed to be afraid of me as well. I don’t know who it was, but I sense that he or she is still nearby.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@Actor[yCKIn7SvDxjfWhN8]{Jedi Master Denia}</strong></p>\n<h2>Through the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>As soon as <strong>Denia </strong>was freed from her comatose state, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> sensed it and awoke his Hutt master. <strong>Darga</strong>, unprepared for having a full-fledged Jedi Master on the loose in his <strong>palace</strong>, ordered <strong>Demos </strong>to ready his personal starship for immediate departure and headed to the planet <strong>Bespin</strong> within <strong>minutes</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>remained behind, charged with eliminating the heroes and<strong> Master Denia </strong>as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Igren Demos</strong> is no fool, and though he tries to stop the heroes, he doubts that he can do it alone (see below for more on his plans). Many of the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> guards are mobilized, and a contingent of warriors moves toward the dungeon area to make sure the heroes do not escape with <strong>Denia</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>locks down the doors in the lower guest quarters area and the dungeon area, shutting off power to the turbolift and sealing the blast doors over the stairwell exit up to the guard room. Using a secret passage from <strong>Darga’s throne room</strong> directly to the dungeon level, the guards open the secret door in the hallway outside <strong>Denia’s </strong>chamber just as the heroes emerge.</p>\n<h2>Out of Captivity</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ifuf0JXwiJJmWe3G]{2-07 Out of Captivity}</strong></p>\n<h2>The Majordomo</h2>\n<p>As soon as<strong> Igren Demos</strong> learned that the <strong>Hutt</strong> was abandoning his <strong>palace </strong>and that the Jedi Master had been freed, he began putting a plan into motion to prevent the prisoner from escaping. <strong>Demos </strong>has secretly been in contact with <strong>Imperial Inquisitor Valin Draco</strong>, a former Jedi who pledged himself to the service of the Empire after witnessing the horrors of the Clone Wars. <strong>Demos </strong>has hidden his <strong>Force-</strong>sensitivity from the Inquisitor thus far, and he hopes that his alliance with the Empire will help him supplant <strong>Darga </strong>and seize control of the organization for his own. When the <strong>Hutt</strong> flees aboard his personal yacht to <strong>Bespin,</strong> <strong>Igren Demos</strong> dispatches the <strong>Gamorreans</strong> to delay the heroes and <strong>Denia</strong> while the majordomo makes contact with <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> via the Holonet. <strong>Demos</strong> implores the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> to come to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> quickly because he has cornered a surviving Jedi Master. <strong>Demos </strong>hopes to turn <strong>Denia</strong> over to the Inquisitorius in exchange for their assistance in making sure that <strong>Darga </strong>never returns to<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for <strong>Demos</strong>, he did not plan on the heroes’ resourcefulness. When they make their way up through the secret passage (as all other avenues are currently blocked), they arrive in the <strong>throne room</strong> just as <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> finishes telling <strong>Demos </strong>that he is on his way.

These informants don’t have the same kind of training that other Imperial agents do. In fact, they are little more than eager civilians who have been given a blaster and some basic combat training.

His <strong>Trandoshan bodyguard</strong> stands nearby (within 6 squares), and <strong>four Gamorrean warriors</strong> linger near the walls, expecting to hear that their comrades below have subdued the heroes.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the heroes enter the audience chamber, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>The darkened audience chamber is much different than when the Hutt crime lord holds court in it.

Though he has never shared the truth with anyone, the Jedi identified him as a potential recruit when he was a child, but his Neimoidian parents refused to let the Jedi take him. Growing up, he learned to use the <strong>Force </strong>to exert his will over others, and when he came into <strong>Darga’s </strong>service, he brought the same skills into play to build a criminal empire. <strong>Demos </strong>is not powerful enough to influence his <strong>Hutt</strong> master, but he continues to use his <strong>Force-</strong>sensitivity in secret to ensure that events occur according to his desires, not necessarily those of the crime lord.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This slender Neimoidian is dressed in robes of dark greens and blues, with a ceremonial headdress that makes him seem taller than he truly is.

He uses <strong>Sever Force </strong>to turn aside <strong>Force powers</strong>. Otherwise, he uses <strong>Force Push/Pull</strong> to deal small amounts of damage to the heroes.

The <strong>bodyguard</strong> serves <strong>Demos </strong>personally and has done so ever since the <strong>palace </strong>on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> was established.

{"_id":"OGdjBMty1OPUU4YU","name":"Introduction<<>>","content":"<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> is the fourth adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e </strong></em>experience. This adventure begins the second act of the campaign, which consists of four adventures: <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em>, <em><strong>The First to Strike</strong></em>, <em><strong>The Core of Corruption,</strong></em> and <em><strong>A Reckoning of Wraiths</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>By now, the heroes have been on a series of adventures together and should be well acquainted with one another. <strong>Several months</strong> have passed since the last adventure, and the heroes should start <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> at <strong>7th level</strong> and reach <strong>9th level</strong> by the conclusion. With some modifications, this adventure can also be used as a stand-alone scenario or as part of your existing campaign. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will visit the ruins of a Jedi academy on the planet <strong>Almas</strong> in search of a Jedi <strong>holocron,</strong> confront evil forces brought forth by a Sith <strong>holocron gatekeeper,</strong> and come face to face with Inquisitor <strong>Valin Draco.</strong></p>\n<h2>Campaign Update</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi </strong></em>opens some months after the last adventure, <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>. The few Jedi who managed to survive <strong>Order 66</strong> are in hiding, hunted down by the Emperor’s <strong>Inquisitors</strong> and <strong>stormtroopers</strong>—and by bounty hunters encouraged by the large sums offered. One Jedi was recently found inside <strong>Darga the Hutt’s palace </strong>on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, but luckily it was by an organization opposed to the Emperor’s tyrannical rule. Thus, <strong>Jedi Master</strong> <strong>Denia</strong> joined <strong>Senator Bail Organa’s</strong> small rebellion, now headquartered in a secret fleet of ships spearheaded by the Nebulon-B cruiser <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. The fleet’s focus is the investigation of a top-secret Imperial military operation called the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>. The existence of the project has been revealed to <strong>Organa </strong>by an Imperial defector, <strong>Admiral Gilder Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes who rescued <strong>Master Denia </strong>have spent the past <strong>months</strong> investigating the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and pursuing other ventures to further their individual careers, though they never lost contact with<strong> Senator Organa</strong>. However, <strong>Captain Sirona Okeefe</strong>, who transported the heroes aboard her ship the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> during their early adventures, has decided to part ways and take her chances with a more lucrative smuggling business. Left without a fast transport, the heroes should have been able to purchase their own starship in <strong>recent months</strong>, either by using the ships gained from <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>, with credits they acquired or by getting a bank loan. (If necessary, <strong>Senator Organa </strong>used his influence to smooth out any difficulty the heroes might have had and recommended a reputable banking institution. He might even have lent them the credits for a down payment, which could have unfolded as part of a side quest.)</p>\n<p>For the player's new ship, you can use the YT-1300 statistics presented below if they don't have a ship and you need to give them one.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;&lt;YT-1300&gt;&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Aside from furthering the training of Jedi heroes, <strong>Master Denia</strong>, now back to full health, has been meditating on the possibility of a link between the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and the <strong>slaves</strong> rescued by the heroes (at the end of the last adventure). But her ability of farseeing through the <strong>Force</strong> is limited, and she has encountered roadblocks where there should be answers. One possible solution has been revealed to her: If she were to obtain a rare Jedi <strong>holocron,</strong> she might be able to augment her <strong>Force</strong> abilities. By doing so, she could better assist <strong>Senator Organa</strong> and the heroes with their goal of foiling the Empire’s nefarious plans. To accomplish this, she requests the heroes’ help.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the heroes, <strong>Inquisitor Valin Draco</strong> felt a strong tremor in the <strong>Force</strong> while they were all in close proximity over <strong>Bespin</strong>—a tremor the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> hasn’t felt since in the presence of his old master. In the course of <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em>, the heroes will come face to face with the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> for the first time inside the ruins of the <strong>Jedi academy</strong> on <strong>Almas.</strong> Although the meeting appears to be one of pure chance, there might be a greater force at work.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the campaign’s second act, the heroes will learn a bit more about <strong>Denia’s </strong>past, her tutelage of <strong>Inquisitor Draco,</strong> and the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> Additionally, this campaign arc concludes much like <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em>, with a series of bad things happening to the heroes. The events of this act are darker in tone but shouldn’t be a series of nothing but down notes. The heroes should reel from their battles, but they also should have a chance to succeed and make progress.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> will give existing<strong> force using </strong>heroes a chance to use their abilities to the fullest and allow new <strong>force users</strong> trained by <strong>Master Denia</strong> to practice what they have learned. But the adventure is not designed for<strong> force users </strong>alone. Heroes of other classes will also contribute their unique talents and skills to resolve conflicts.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Background</h2>\n<p>Abandoned and half buried in the sands of <strong>Almas</strong> for more than a <strong>millennium, Darth Rivan’s</strong> fortress has been recently invaded and pillaged by <strong>Jedi</strong> and <strong>Sith cultists.</strong> His tomes, amulets, and other artifacts have been stolen. Even the corrupt spirit of his failed apprentice <strong>Darsin,</strong> left behind as the stronghold’s guardian has been defeated. But <strong>Rivan’s</strong> sarcophagus has been found empty.</p>\n<p>In truth, the remnants of his dark influence has lingered for centuries in a diluted state in the cold, desert wastes surrounding the fortress, inching gradually toward the <strong>Force nexus</strong> over which the <strong>Jedi</strong> built their <strong>academy.</strong> This dark energy is responsible for the death of the world’s <strong>kaluthin plant</strong>—which <strong>Rivan</strong> himself engineered so long ago—as death and decay slowly spreads outward from his fortress. The recent destruction of the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> has strengthened this evil energy in this region. The spread of the dark side across <strong>Almas</strong> has left behind a blight of withered <strong>kaluthin</strong> that is visible from orbit. The power of the dark side in <strong>Almas</strong> has also attracted other creatures that feed on the <strong>Force,</strong> and they have followed it to its source in the bowels of the ravaged <strong>Jedi academy.</strong></p>\n<p>The residents of the city of <strong>Forard,</strong> still reeling from the destruction of the <strong>academy</strong> at its center during <strong>Order 66,</strong> made an effort to go on with their lives, but they couldn’t escape the impact of the <strong>dark side.</strong> Over a <strong>few short months</strong>, many local citizens inexplicably became violent, crime rose far beyond what local police could handle, and some people simply dropped dead. Fear and death quickly left the city deserted as residents relocated to other planets in the system with help from the now-independent <strong>Cularin Militia.</strong></p>\n<p>After <strong>months</strong> of interrogating <strong>Force-sensitive prisoners</strong>, <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> learned of a <strong>holocron</strong> in the <strong>Cularin system</strong> that supposedly contained ancient Sith knowledge. He swept the system for <strong>Jedi</strong> who might have survived the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> bombardment but did not find the refugees protected by <strong>Cularin’s</strong> natives, the Tarasin. <strong>Draco</strong> arrived at the <strong>academy</strong> ruins and was immediately entranced by an intoxicating surge of the <strong>dark side.</strong> Attempting to locate the source of this power, <strong>Draco</strong> went into the sublevels of the <strong>Jedi academy,</strong> where he chanced upon a fortunate discovery.</p>\n<p>Deep within the <strong>academy</strong> was the Sith <strong>holocron</strong> he sought, which once belonged to the Sith Lord <strong>Darth Rivan.</strong> Moreover, the growing <strong>dark side</strong> energy on <strong>Almas</strong> had suffused the <strong>Rivan holocron</strong> with a powerful evil. As a result, the <strong>holocron’s gatekeeper</strong> took on a life of its own, believing itself to be the actual spirit of <strong>Darth Rivan,</strong> and it gained the power to activate itself and act of its own free will. <strong>Draco</strong> learned much from the faux <strong>Sith Lord</strong> spirit, and he remained in the academy to study the <strong>holocron</strong> further.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Vhiin’Thorla,</strong> a Twi’lek <strong>Jedi,</strong> who had been away on his homeworld when <strong>Order 66</strong> took place, visited the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> with his <strong>Padawan</strong> in hopes of finding survivors. When <strong>Draco</strong> encountered them, a fierce lightsaber duel ensued, and <strong>Draco’s protégé Raik Muun</strong> used trickery to induce <strong>Thorla’s Padawan</strong> into a murderous rage directed at his own master. <strong>Thorla</strong> was forced to kill his own <strong>Padawan</strong> in self-defense, and, wracked with grief, was easily captured. <strong>Draco</strong> imprisoned the <strong>Jedi Master</strong> in a <strong>Force-annulling Universal Energy Cage.</strong> For a <strong>week</strong> leading up to the heroes’ arrival, <strong>Draco</strong> has conspired with the <strong>holocron gatekeeper</strong> to break <strong>Thorla</strong> and turn him to the <strong>dark side.</strong></p>\n<h3>Adventure Summary</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> opens with the heroes being sent to the planet <strong>Almas,</strong> in the <strong>Cularin</strong> system, to retrieve an ancient <strong>holocron</strong> from the ruins of the <strong>Jedi academy</strong> that once stood there. En route they are attacked by pirates, and eventually, they make their way down to the surface of the planet. Delving deep into the ruined <strong>academy,</strong> they fight off evil <strong>dark side</strong> creatures, zealous followers of an ancient <strong>Sith lord,</strong> monstrous beasts, and the crumbling ruins of the <strong>academy</strong> itself.

The <strong>warlord</strong> is a commander of soldiers and treats the <strong>Gamorreans</strong> in <strong>Darga’s </strong>service like his own private army. Though <strong>Darga </strong>has had to warn him in the past about getting too ambitious, the <strong>warlord’s</strong> resolve to defeat any threat to his new clan’s dominance ensures that the <strong>Hutt</strong> always has a dangerous security force at his disposal.

The <strong>Gamorreans</strong> do not sound an alarm right away, believing that they can take the heroes down without assistance (and thus garner more glory for themselves). However, if the fight goes poorly, a <strong>Gamorrean</strong> next to a computer console spends a bonus action to activate the alarm.

The journey from <strong>Alderaan </strong>to <strong>Felucia </strong>is relatively uneventful and should give the heroes plenty of downtime before their mission begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Felucia </strong>is an out-of-the-way jungle world where massive mushrooms dominate the landscape. The native <strong>Felucians </strong>retreated into hiding many years ago when Gossam colonists<strong> </strong>came to the world. Though the fierce battles of the Clone Wars made their way to the planet eventually, <strong>Felucia </strong>was left largely unscathed, and once the Separatist forces were defeated, the newly created Empire mostly withdrew from the system. As <strong>Bail Organa</strong> explained to the heroes, the Imperial presence on <strong>Felucia</strong> is based primarily around protecting the small <strong>prison facility </strong>left on the world. The few cities on <strong>Felucia </strong>have Imperial garrisons, and the Gossam colonists remaining on the world after the Clone Wars must deal with Imperial persecution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the heroes won’t be going anywhere near the cities. The <strong>prison facility</strong>, which does not exist on any official maps, is located deep in the <strong>Felucian jungle</strong>. If not for the <strong>Alderaanian Security agent </strong>frozen in carbonite, neither <strong>Bail Organa</strong> nor the heroes would have any knowledge of the facility’s location. The <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>has the coordinates in its nav computer, and the course plotted by <strong>RX-13</strong> should bring the ship out of hyperspace on the side of the planet nearest to the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Evasive Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>As the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>emerges from hyperspace, <strong>Crash </strong>informs <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> that their trajectory was perfect and that they are approaching in a vector that will take them to the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. Almost instantaneously, the sensor board lights up with contacts — Imperial contacts. The massive, dagger-shaped visage of a <strong>Victory-class Star Destroyer</strong> looms above the planet, and within <strong>seconds</strong> the flickering sensor board indicates that the capital ship has turned to intercept the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>. <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> orders everyone to strap in so that she can make evasive maneuvers.</p>\n<p>When the heroes comply, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the blue tunnel of hyperspace fades away and the pinpoints of stars fill the windows of the cockpit, you get a brief glimpse of the planet Felucia hanging just below your ship. Almost instantly your eyes are drawn to the dagger-shaped starship looming ahead of you — an Imperial Star Destroyer.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Hold on,” Captain Okeefe says, “We’re in for a bumpy ride.”</em></p>\n<p><em>With that, the captain slams the control stick forward, sending the ship tumbling rapidly into the atmosphere of the planet. As the Banshee passes through the thin cloud layer, you get a good look at the fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia, where towering mushrooms reach up into the air like skyscrapers. It would be beautiful if it weren’t rushing up at you so quickly.</em></p>\n<p><em>Eventually, Captain Okeefe pulls the ship out of its dive, a move accompanied by the sounds of metal shearing from somewhere in the rear of the ship. The transport lurches, nearly throwing each of you to the ground, and dips sickeningly down toward the fungal canopy. Another massive bump jostles the ship before the captain brings the vessel to a screeching halt, resting deep within the mushroom jungles.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Searching for Civilization</h2>\n<p>When the dust settles, <strong>Captain Okeefe </strong>and <strong>Crash </strong>quickly move around the ship, assessing the damage and ensuring that no one is injured. After a <strong>few minutes</strong>, <strong>the captain</strong> opens the hatch and steps outside into the jungle. The thick, humid air seeps into the ship almost immediately, and soon she returns with less than stellar news. While the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>has survived the landing mostly intact, it won’t be taking off any time soon. <strong>Okeefe</strong> thinks she can make the repairs, and fortunately the ship is hidden by the Felucian jungle’s canopy. However, she cannot give the heroes an estimate of when the work will be done. She suggests (if the heroes don’t do so themselves) that they make their way through the jungle toward the <strong>prison</strong>. The ship’s navigational systems brought the vessel down near the <strong>prison facility</strong>, so it shouldn’t take them more than a <strong>day </strong>or so to trek through the jungle and discover the ultimate fate of <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p>Although supplies are limited, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> offers to give the heroes whatever food or water she has. There are enough removable supplies on the ship to provide water and nourishment for a <strong>week’s journey</strong>, though the heroes certainly shouldn’t be gone that long.<strong> The captain</strong> provides them with the directions to the<strong> prison facility</strong>, which she can upload into any datapads carried by the heroes. This should give them the location of the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> and the relative location of the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>so they can make their way back.</p>\n<p>When the heroes first step off of the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Your first steps onto the soil of Felucia make it clear that this planet is truly alive. Massive mushrooms tower overhead, their overhanging edges creating a canopy that blocks out much of the planet’s sunlight. Every step on Felucian soil turns up insects and other fungi just beneath the surface. The noise of the jungle is loud and alien, full of the sounds of a hundred insects and animals moving through the mushroom swamps, all part of a living and vibrant ecosystem.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Traveling through the jungle toward the Imperial <strong>prison </strong>requires frequent <strong>Survival checks</strong> to stay on course and avoid hazards. The journey requires at least<strong> 12 hours’</strong> worth of successful progress from the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>to the facility. The heroes must make a <strong>DC 15 Survival check </strong>each <strong>hour </strong>of travel. Success indicates that they make progress toward their destination, whereas failure results in no progress. If the hero making the <strong>Survival check</strong> fails the <strong>check </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong>, the group might encounter a <strong>hazard</strong>. Sample hazards are described below, but you should feel free to include any other jungle <strong>hazards</strong> appropriate to the planet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acid Pool (CR 1):</strong> Acid pools are dangerous hazards on <strong>Felucia </strong>because they resemble pools of standing water. Each acid pool can be detected with a successful<strong> DC 10 Perception check</strong>. Any hero who fails this <strong>Perception check</strong> steps in a pool of acid, taking <strong>[[/r 1d6[acid] # Acid damage]] </strong><strong>damage</strong>. Each <strong>round </strong>thereafter, the character must make a <strong>DC 12 Constitution saving throw </strong>or take an additional <strong>[[/r 1d6[acid] # Acid damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>when. The acid stops damaging the target whenever the target succeeds in a <strong>saving throw</strong>, or if the hero washes the acid off with water.</li>\n<li><strong>Exploding Fungus Bloom (CR 2):</strong> These blooms are filled with chemicals that become highly explosive and flammable when combined. When the heroes encounter this hazard, one hero at random bumps into an exploding fungus bloom. The bloom explodes, making a <strong>ranged attack </strong>with a <strong><strong><strong>+3 attack</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> </span><strong>bonus (</strong></strong>[[/r 1d20+3 # Exploding Fungus Bloom]]) </strong>and dealing <strong>[[/r 2d6[energy] # Energy damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>as a flash incinerates the fungus.</li>\n<li><strong>Razor Mushroom (CR 2): </strong>These fungi are extremely dangerous and, like the exploding fungus blooms, activate only when someone gets too close. If the heroes encounter this hazard, one hero at random passes too close to a razor mushroom. The mushroom bursts outward with spines and razor-sharp tendrils, making a <strong>melee attack</strong> against that hero with a <strong>+3 attack bonus <strong><strong><strong>(</strong></strong>[[/r 1d20+3 # Razor Mushroom]])</strong> </strong>and dealing <strong>[[/r 1d6+2[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>on a successful <strong>attack</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Sinkhole (CR 1):</strong> Throughout the jungle are a number of sinkholes, created when the roots of a massive fungus rot away but leave detritus in the ground. Spotting a sinkhole requires a <strong>DC 10 Perception check</strong>, and success means the sinkhole is avoided. Any hero who fails this <strong>check </strong>falls into the sinkhole, which is f<strong>ifteen feet deep</strong> and leads to a pit with a thin layer of sludge at the bottom. Any hero who falls in takes normal falling <strong>damage (</strong><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">[[/r 1d6[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In the Wilds</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have made at least<strong> 6 hours’</strong> worth of progress toward their destination, they encounter a group of natives—a <strong>Felucian scout party</strong>, just returning from patrol. Of late, the <strong>Felucian villages</strong> have been plagued by Imperial agents capturing their scouts, and as a result the <strong>Felucians </strong>are extremely wary of outsiders. As the heroes enter a clearing, four <strong>Felucian scouts</strong> emerge from the underbrush, thinking them to be more Imperial agents.</p>\n<h2>Felucian Hospitality</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[Xdp7L3jQuHGRtfMH]{1-04 Felucian Hospitality}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>After the heroes defeat the <strong>Felucians</strong>, they should quickly discover that they are on the outskirts of some kind of <strong>village</strong>. Once the noises of battle die down, the heroes can make out sounds just through the jungle. As they follow these sounds, they find a makeshift <strong>village </strong>on the other side of the undergrowth populated with more <strong>Felucians</strong>, as well as a few other surprises.</p>\n<h2>Felucian Sanctuary</h2>\n<p>A hidden village deep within the <strong>Felucian </strong>jungle, this sanctuary is home to more than a dozen <strong>Felucian </strong>families. Additionally, a former Separatist soldier, now a hermit on the fungal world, resides in the <strong>village</strong>, hiding from the Empire. The sanctuary has remained a secret in the months since the Empire took over, and it is a place where the Separatist and the <strong>Felucians </strong>can live without fear of Imperial discovery.</p>\n<p>The <strong>village </strong>provides a place for the heroes to rest and recuperate a bit from their trek through the jungle. Additionally, the sanctuary offers a number of interesting roleplaying opportunities for the heroes, allowing them to interact with the locals and discover more about the conditions on the planet. If the heroes are reluctant to enter the <strong>village </strong>due to their recent conflict with the <strong>Felucian scouts</strong>, feel free to use the following to motivate them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The former Separatist, an older man named <strong>Vazus Mandrake</strong> (described under “<strong>The Translator</strong>”), invites the heroes into the <strong>village</strong>, explaining that their fight with the<strong> Felucian scouts </strong>was just a misunderstanding.</li>\n<li>The heroes notice signs that the <strong>Felucians </strong>aren’t friendly to the Empire—such as an effigy, dressed in stormtrooper armor, hanging outside the <strong>village</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can impress upon the heroes the fact that the <strong>village </strong>might be a good place to ensure that their directions are correct and learn about any other hazards leading up to the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the heroes enter the <strong>village</strong>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The village appears to have been carved almost completely out of the massive mushrooms that dominate the Felucian landscape. Each one looks old and petrified, making the mushroom huts appear far more solid than their still-living counterparts elsewhere in the jungle. In the center of the village, a number of native Felucians gather in a half circle, squatting by a cooking fire and turning to look at you as you enter. Though the village area has been cleared, small mushrooms and other plants still rise up from the ground, as though the jungle itself resisted any attempts at civilization.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While in the <strong>village</strong>, the heroes are approached cautiously until they convince the residents that they mean no harm. If any of the heroes has (or is) a protocol droid or other droid with a translator unit, they find that most of the <strong>villagers </strong>are <strong>indifferent </strong>toward the visitors. Unless the heroes are visibly pretending to be Imperial officials, the <strong>villagers </strong>are more curious about them than anything else. If the heroes can befriend the <strong>Felucians</strong>, the natives are happy to take them in and provide them with food and shelter, at least for a short time. Most of the <strong>villagers</strong> believe any non-Imperial visitors to be victims of Imperial oppression, as they are, and the <strong>Felucians </strong>are always eager to assist anyone who is not an agent of the Empire.</p>\n<p>The encounters described below can occur any time that the heroes are in the <strong>village</strong>. Feel free to use the location as a place where the heroes can recuperate and interact with the locals. In <strong>part 3</strong> of The <em><strong>Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, the heroes will confront captured <strong>Felucians </strong>that have been tormented and twisted by the Empire. Therefore, use this time to let the heroes get to know the natives so that they will be more sympathetic later.</p>\n<h3>The Translator</h3>\n<p>Living among the native <strong>Felucians </strong>is a former Separatist commander named <strong>@Actor[ryiPykBLIK2EBZHZ]{Vazus Mandrake}</strong>. A middle-aged Human male from <strong>Corulag </strong>with a scarred face and stringy gray hair, <strong>Mandrake</strong> was stranded on <strong>Felucia </strong>during the Clone Wars after his mercenary unit was destroyed by clone troopers. Crawling off into the jungle while grievously wounded, <strong>Mandrake </strong>managed to escape execution by the clone troopers and nursed himself back to health. When the war ended and the Empire rose, <strong>Mandrake </strong>decided to make his home among the <strong>Felucians</strong>, where he has been living ever since. He also tends a small group of <strong>kybucks </strong>that he imported to the world when his unit was stationed here. Although his unit fell, the <strong>kybucks </strong>survived, and <strong>Mandrake </strong>has named them all after his former comrades.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not have a translator droid, <strong>Vazus</strong> <strong>Mandrake </strong>approaches them and offers to serve as their go-between with the <strong>villagers</strong>. <strong>Mandrake</strong> is an expert in the <strong>Felucians</strong>’ guttural tongue, and he can converse with them fluently. He is immediately curious about the heroes and their intentions, and if they make it clear that they are not allies of the Empire, he treats them like old friends. Though bitter about his defeat at the hands of the Empire, <strong>Mandrake</strong> is genial and happily translates for the heroes. He is initially <strong>indifferent </strong>towards them, but becomes <strong>friendly </strong>if they mention that they are opposed to the Empire. If the heroes succeed on a <strong>DC 10 persuasion check</strong>, he will not only translate for them but also attempt to aid another on any <strong>Persuasion checks</strong> the heroes make on the <strong>Felucians</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mandrake </strong>is an important ally for the heroes. In addition to his ability to translate for them, he has some knowledge of the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. If the heroes mention the facility in <strong>Mandrake’s </strong>presence, his face darkens and he becomes very serious. <strong>Mandrake </strong>has wanted to destroy the <strong>prison </strong>for some time now, though his new life among the <strong>Felucians </strong>has cooled his passions somewhat and he is no longer so gung-ho about doing the job himself. If he learns of the heroes’ intentions to raid the facility, he begs them to help him with his sabotage. <strong>Mandrake </strong>produces a large <strong>explosive charge</strong> and explains that if they can set it in the facility’s <strong>communications center</strong>, the blast should be powerful enough to destroy the <strong>prison</strong> and overload Imperial communications on <strong>Felucia</strong> for some time. That will also make it easier for the heroes to escape from <strong>Felucia</strong>. If the heroes agree, <strong>Mandrake</strong> gives them the <strong>explosive charge</strong> and shows them how to set the timer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/vasuz_mandrake_art.webp\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[IpZ1VH3dKjGFCHYK]{06 - Handout 6 - Vazus Mandrake}</p>\n<h3>Scrutiny of the Chief</h3>\n<p>After the heroes have been in the <strong>village </strong>for a short time, they are approached by an elderly Felucian shaman that <strong>Mandrake</strong> (or the heroes’ translator droid) describes as<strong> the chief</strong>. <strong>@Actor[Lh6AQYxTCYVbXxO4]{The Felucian Chief}</strong> is obviously extremely old, and the tendrils around his head appear to be shrunken and damaged. The shaman has also seen his share of battles; his body is covered in scars, and one arm looks withered and blackened as though infected with some kind of shriveling disease.</p>\n<p><strong>The chief </strong>comes to the heroes and scrutinizes them, looking them over without saying a word. If any heroes in the party are <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive, <strong>the chief </strong>pays particular attention to them, and such characters hear faint, guttural whispers as he passes by. On the other hand, if any heroes have a dark <strong>power</strong> or <strong>alignment</strong>, <strong>the chief </strong>appears to scowl at them, his gaze lingering just a bit longer than on the others.</p>\n<p>After a brief examination of the heroes, <strong>the chief </strong>turns to them as a group and begins to speak. Particularly, he wants to know who they are, why they have come to <strong>Felucia</strong>, and what they intend to do about the Empire. (<strong>The chief</strong> secretly hopes that they might help discourage the Empire from staying on <strong>Felucia</strong>, though he shows no signs of it.) This encounter is one of the most important the heroes can have in the <strong>village</strong>, and much depends on how they treat <strong>the chief </strong>and how they answer his questions.</p>\n<h4>Critical Challenge</h4>\n<p>The most beneficial outcome of the meeting with<strong> the chief </strong>is that the heroes gain the trust and help of the <strong>Felucian village</strong>. Specifically, if the heroes succeed in this challenge, <strong>the chief </strong>appoints a scout from the <strong>village </strong>to guide them to the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. To achieve this, the heroes must win the friendship of<strong> the chief.</strong> Once<strong> the chief</strong> has been made friendly, he is willing to consider providing them with a guide. <strong>The chief </strong>speaks of the numerous dangers in the jungle (many of which the heroes might have encountered already) and cautions them not to proceed lightly. Although they have made it this far, there are many hazards that they have not yet faced, among them massive predators such as the Felucian <strong>rancor</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes indicate that they will do something more permanent about the Imperial presence on <strong>Felucia</strong> (such as planting <strong>Mandrake’s </strong>explosive charge), <strong>the chief</strong> agrees to provide them with a scout who can lead them directly to the facility. On the other hand, if the heroes keep their intentions closer to the vest (or if they refused <strong>Mandrake’s </strong>request), they can win the aid of<strong> the chief </strong>in other ways.</p>\n<p>If the heroes leave any of their supplies (such as those taken off the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>) for the <strong>villagers</strong>, <strong>the chief</strong> is grateful and grants his aid.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if the heroes offer to help the <strong>village </strong>in any other material way (such as by arming the <strong>Felucians </strong>with advanced weapons or providing them with medicine), <strong>the chief</strong> is grateful and provides his aid.</p>\n<p>If the heroes discover and heal the sick <strong>Felucian children</strong> (see the “Sick Children” encounter, below),<strong> the chief</strong> automatically grants his aid.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 1</h4>\n<p>One other thing the heroes can do during this encounter is learn a bit more about the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. If <strong>the chief</strong> can be made friendly to the heroes and any hero asks about the <strong>prison</strong>, that hero can make a <strong>DC 10 Investigation check </strong>to learn more about the facility. If successful, the heroes learn that the <strong>villagers</strong> call it the “<em><strong>Vanishing Plac</strong><strong>e</strong></em>” and steer clear of it whenever possible.<strong> The chief </strong>explains that many <strong>Felucians </strong>have disappeared in the area around the <strong>Vanishing Place</strong>, and when the <strong>Felucians</strong> sent a few shamans to investigate, they had to leave quickly before they were overwhelmed with pain. <strong>The chief</strong> believes that many of the missing <strong>Felucians </strong>are being held in the <strong>prison facility</strong>, and that the Empire is causing them great pain.<strong> The chief</strong> also tells the heroes that the source of the pain seems most concentrated on the west side of the facility.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 2</h4>\n<p><strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes have an opportunity to impress <strong>the chief</strong> and gain some of his knowledge. If <strong>the chief</strong> is friendly to the heroes, he can be convinced to give up a bit of <strong>Force</strong> lore. Any character who acknowledges his or her own <strong>Force </strong>sensitivity to<strong> the chief </strong>also gains his interest. <strong>The chief </strong>is eager to learn more about the ways of the <strong>Force</strong>, especially from outsiders, and he is willing to trade knowledge. If any hero demonstrates an aptitude for the <strong>Force </strong>that <strong>the chief</strong> himself does not have — perhaps in the form of a <strong>Force power</strong> or other <strong>Force </strong>ability with visible results — that hero receives some <strong>Force </strong>tutelage from <strong>the chief</strong>. Specifically, the hero learns the <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.forcepowers.CJiHSga5F10ZTKMg]{Burst} at-will power </strong>as an additional known <strong>power</strong>. Alternatively, this is a chance for you (the GM) to introduce any new <strong>Force powers</strong> or abilities into the campaign that might be available only to certain Forceusers, especially <strong>powers </strong>or abilities that differ greatly from those in the <em><strong>SW5e Player's Handbook</strong></em>.</p>\n<h4>Ad-Hoc XP Award</h4>\n<p><strong>Ad-Hoc XP Award:</strong> If the heroes succeed in the critical challenge of this encounter and obtain a scout, grant them experience points as though they had overcome a <strong>CR 4 opponent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Sick Children</h3>\n<p>Several of the younger <strong>Felucians</strong> in the <strong>village </strong>have fallen ill in <strong>recent days</strong>, many of them deteriorating to the point of paralysis. The <strong>Felucians</strong> have hidden these children away in one of their mushroom huts, and only a hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong> while walking through the <strong>village </strong>notices their anguished cries. If the hero investigates further, he or she discovers four <strong>Felucian children</strong> who lie on cots, frail and nearly immobile except when they cry out in pain. In truth, the children have contracted a virus engineered by <strong>Captain Vischera</strong> in the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> (see Part 3 for more information on <strong>Vischera </strong>and his experiments). The children’s skin has faded to a sickly gray, and their muscles have thinned to the point that they are visibly too weak to support their weight.</p>\n<p>A hero can treat the virus with a <strong>DC 10 Medicine check</strong>, and curing the children requires <strong>8 hours</strong> of tending. Feel free to let the heroes take this time, since there is no real time restraint during this part of the adventure. Although the heroes should feel the illusion of pressure (reaching the <strong>prison facility</strong> before some ill fate befalls <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>), they should not be punished for an altruistic act.</p>\n<h4>Ad-Hoc XP Award</h4>\n<p>If the heroes cure the sick children, award them experience points as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 2 enemy</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Imperial Scout</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have had a chance to interact with the <strong>villagers</strong> and deal with the encounters above, have them make <strong>DC 10 Perception checks</strong>. Any hero who succeeds notices a low whine coming from the outskirts of the <strong>village</strong>, as though a repulsor were passing around its edges. Upon further investigation, the heroes spot a on a <strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[sw5e.monsters.OVoCEGeBAWhEVzME]{Speeder Bike}</span></strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> zooming away from the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">village</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">, headed into the deep jungle. They catch only a glimpse of him before he speeds out of view, but it seems certain that the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">scout trooper</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> saw them.</span></p>\n<p>If the heroes don’t realize it immediately, <strong>Vazus Mandrake</strong> does: The <strong>scout trooper </strong>will report the hidden <strong>Felucian village</strong>—and the presence of the heroes—to his superiors, and soon after, <strong>stormtroopers </strong>will descend upon them. Fortunately, though, the mushrooms in the area have chemicals in their stalks that block long-range communications, so there is little chance that the <strong>scout trooper</strong> could report his findings before reaching his base. Thus, <strong>Mandrake </strong>begs the heroes to take his <strong>kybucks</strong> and chase the <strong>scout trooper</strong> down. He assures them that the <strong>kybucks</strong> are tame (which is true) and urges them to catch the Imperial scout before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>If all of the heroes fail the <strong>Perception check </strong>above, they still notice the <strong>scout trooper</strong>, but each hero has <strong>disadvantage </strong>on his or her <strong>Initiative check</strong> when the chase sequence begins.</p>\n<h3>Zone 1: The Chase Begins</h3>\n<p>The heroes mount their <strong>@Actor[lCHQkfQTaRCJjvWu]{Kybucks}</strong>, and the chase begins! Have each hero roll <strong>Initiative </strong>as normal; this will determine not only the order in which they act, but also their <strong>Initiative score</strong> in the encounter at the end of the chase sequence. On the <strong>first round</strong> of the chase sequence, the heroes can mount the <strong>kybucks </strong>as normal. As promised, the <strong>kybucks </strong>are tamed and ready for riding. If the character controls them (restricting the mount to <strong>Dash</strong>, <strong>Disengage</strong>, and <strong>Dodge </strong>actions), a hero can direct his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>out of the <strong>village</strong> and in pursuit of the <strong>scout trooper</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Kybucks </strong>move very, very quickly, and as the beasts lurch forward, the heroes realize that they’ll have no trouble keeping up with a <strong>speeder bike</strong>. Large mushrooms and other huge fungi streak by faster than the eye can see, and the ground whips by at an incredible pace. The <strong>kybucks </strong>provide a relatively smooth ride, and it is clear that the animals know the terrain far better than any of the heroes might. Each <strong>kybuck</strong> leaps, turns, twists, and dodges between the massive growths of the fungal forest. Throughout the chase sequence, be sure to emphasize the speed at which the heroes are moving.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>first round </strong>of the chase, the heroes streak out of the <strong>village </strong>and into an area of sparse growth. Although <strong>Animal Handling checks</strong> are not needed to control the <strong>kybucks</strong>, have each hero make a<strong> DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong> during the <strong>first round</strong> regardless.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> less than 5 </strong>is accepted by his or her <strong>kybuck</strong>, and the beast dashes through the jungle with no ill effect for the rest of the chase.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> (in other words, with a roll of <strong>15 or higher</strong>) also gains <strong>advantage </strong>on<strong> Animal Handling checks</strong> for the remainder of the chase sequence.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>less than 5</strong> can make a<strong> DC 10 Persuasion check</strong> as a <strong>free action </strong>to calm his or her <strong>kybuck</strong> for no ill effect. Failure means the hero has <strong>disadvantage </strong>on <strong>Animal Handling checks</strong> made through the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the initial <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> has <strong>disadvantage</strong> on <strong>Animal Handling checks </strong>made through the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>scout trooper</strong> is almost completely out of <strong>Zone 1</strong> when the chase begins. During the <strong>first round</strong> of combat, the <strong>scout trooper</strong> is out of line of sight from the heroes. You (the GM) should roll <strong>Initiative </strong>for the <strong>scout trooper</strong> as normal, moving him from zone to zone just as the heroes move, though the scout technically begins the chase at the far end of <strong>Zone 1</strong>. As such, even though a hero might advance to the next zone before the <strong>scout trooper</strong> does, the scout will always be farther ahead of the heroes in the next zone when the heroes’ turn comes up. On subsequent <strong>rounds</strong>, the heroes might have a chance to draw closer to the <strong>scout trooper</strong> on his speeder bike. In any <strong>round</strong> in which the heroes manage to draw close enough to the scout to stop his progress (with a <strong>ranged attack</strong>, a <strong>Force power</strong>, or some other means), another<strong> scout trooper </strong>zooms ahead from a hidden post, moving into the next zone and out of line of sight immediately. This allows you to keep the chase going while letting the heroes gain experience points for defeating any <strong>scout troopers </strong>they manage to catch.</p>\n<p>After the <strong>first round</strong> of the chase sequence, all of the heroes who move their mounts into the jungle automatically advance to <strong>Zone 2</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Zone 2: The Fungal Swamp</h3>\n<p>The second zone of the chase is a massive fungal swamp. In this zone, shallow pools of water litter the landscape, and the <strong>kybucks</strong> send up huge splashes as their hoofed feet pass through the puddles. Large, multicolored fungi droop low over the landscape, and huge birds swoop down to scoop up prey. The fungal swamp is so thick that the heroes can hardly see in front of them; anything beyond <strong>100 feet</strong> is out of their line of sight. The <strong>kybucks </strong>have no difficulty navigating the swampy terrain, though the heroes should feel as though the jungle is closing in on them.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>less than 5</strong> manages to lead his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>out of the fungal swamp.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by<strong> 5 or more </strong>also moves within <strong>Long range</strong> of a <strong>blaster pistol</strong> (<strong>160 ft.</strong>) of the <strong>scout trooper</strong>. If the hero chooses a different path than the <strong>scout </strong>(see below), he remains within that range for <strong>Zone 4</strong> as well.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the<strong> Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> less than 5 </strong>can make a <strong>DC 10 Perception check</strong> as a <strong>free action</strong> to keep from getting lost in the thick undergrowth. Failure means the hero and his or her <strong>kybuck</strong> get lost in the fungal swamp and do not advance to the next zone of the chase on the next <strong>round</strong>. Although this does not have immediate consequences, it can prevent the hero from joining his comrades in the encounter at the end of the chase.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the initial <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> gets lost in the fungal swamp and does not advance, as described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each hero who advances through <strong>Zone 2 </strong>to the next zone of the chase must choose a path to follow. On each hero’s turn in this zone, describe two paths: one that appears to go through thick foliage, and another that travels through the hollowed-out trunk of a massive Felucian tree. Randomly determine which path the <strong>scout trooper</strong> takes with his speeder bike. Any heroes who choose the path through the foliage proceed to <strong>Zone 3A </strong>below. Any heroes who choose the path through the tree proceed to <strong>Zone 3B</strong> below. Both paths converge again in <strong>Zone 4</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Zone 3A: Hazardous Terrain</h3>\n<p>Any heroes who choose the path covered with thick overgrowth soon find themselves in treacherous terrain. This zone is filled with sinkholes and trenches, causing the <strong>kybucks </strong>to leap over the small gorges and chasms with bouncing grace. As the animals bound through this zone, the heroes dip and rise along with the terrain, making it difficult to see very far ahead.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> less than 5 </strong>manages to help direct his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>to the next zone without any difficulties.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> 5 or more </strong>also gains <strong>advantage </strong>on <strong>Animal Handling checks</strong> in the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5</strong> is moved down by <strong>2</strong> in the <strong>Initiative order </strong>for the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the<strong> </strong><strong>Animal Handling check</strong><strong> </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong> is moved down by <strong>5</strong> in the <strong>Initiative order </strong>for the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each hero who advances to the next zone automatically advances to <strong>Zone 4</strong>. Any hero who managed to close with the <strong>scout trooper</strong> in the previous zone can make <strong>attacks </strong>or use <strong>Force powers</strong> against the scout in this <strong>round </strong>(but only if the scout followed this path, of course).</p>\n<h3>Zone 3B: Natural Tunnels</h3>\n<p>Heroes who choose the path through the hollowed-out tree find themselves traveling through a series of hollow logs and underground tunnels. The heroes and their mounts must lower their heads to prevent scraping the ceiling of these natural passageways. As the <strong>kybucks </strong>zip through the underground tunnels, chunks of moss and other fungi droop down from above, while breaks in the ceiling let occasional rays of light shine down on the heroes.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5 </strong>progresses to the next zone without incident.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by<strong> 5 or more</strong> also closes further with the <strong>scout trooper</strong>, drawing within <strong>160 ft</strong>. (if the hero had not closed with the scout on previous <strong>rounds</strong>) or within <strong>40 ft. </strong>(if the hero had previously closed with the scout).</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5</strong> rides too close to a grasping set of roots that hang down into the tunnel, like tentacles. That hero must succeed on an opposed<strong> grapple check</strong> (versus the roots, which have a<strong> +2 bonus</strong>) to continue to the next zone. A failed <strong>check</strong> means that the hero and his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>becomes stuck in the natural tunnels, and on the following <strong>round </strong>the hero can take an action to disentangle from the roots.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong><strong> </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong> runs into the hanging roots at full speed and is knocked off the <strong>kybuck</strong>. The animal stops and waits for the hero to mount up again the following <strong>round</strong>, but the hero is delayed in advancing until the following <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any hero not snagged in the natural tunnels automatically advances to<strong> Zone 4</strong>. Any hero who managed to close with the <strong>scout trooper</strong> in the previous zone can make <strong>attacks </strong>or use <strong>Force powers </strong>against the scout in this <strong>round </strong>(but only if the scout followed this path, of course).</p>\n<h3>Zone 4: Awakening the Beast</h3>\n<p>When the heroes advance to Zone 4, they encounter a deadly specimen of Felucian fauna: a <strong>@Actor[nBEnHoSnp9X16zjq]{Rancor}</strong>. Fortunately, the creature is dying, and its death throes are all that it can bring to bear against the riders.</p>\n<p>When the first heroes move into this zone, the ground in front of them erupts. The <strong>rancor </strong>had buried itself under the dirt and undergrowth, and now it rises up and attempts to grab a hero and a <strong>kybuck </strong>as a last meal. The <strong>rancor </strong>is sluggish, but as it rises to its full height, pieces of debris and detritus fall off its body, creating a rain of soil and plants that spatters any heroes who race past.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5</strong> manages to lead his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>past the dying <strong>rancor </strong>without being slashed by its claws.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the<strong> Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> 5 or more</strong> avoids any <strong>attack </strong>by the <strong>rancor </strong>and increases his or her <strong>Initiative by +2</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5 </strong>is <strong>attacked </strong>by the <strong>rancor</strong>. However, the <strong>attack </strong>is a glancing blow, dealing <strong>[[/r 1d6[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>on a success.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> is <strong>attacked </strong>by the <strong>rancor</strong>. The creature makes a melee <strong>attack </strong>against the hero at a <strong>+8 bonus</strong>, dealing<strong>[[/r 2d6+5[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>on a success.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if a hero is <strong>attacked </strong>by the <strong>rancor</strong>, all heroes who make it through the zone advance to<strong> Zone 5</strong>, an Imperial outpost.</p>\n<h3>Zone 5: Valley Outpost</h3>\n<p>After encountering the <strong>rancor</strong>, the heroes leave the area of dense fungal growth and move into a clearing with a small river cutting through it. Though the river is shallow, it is relatively wide, and the <strong>kybucks </strong>splash through the river as it turns north toward a narrow valley. The <strong>scout trooper</strong> flies through this area just above the river, the speeder bike’s repulsors splitting the water and kicking up a wake. Several large, bulbous mushrooms rise out of the riverbank, creating large obstacles for anyone moving through the zone.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5 </strong>advances to the combat encounter with no incidents and no special <strong>penalties </strong>or <strong>bonuses</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> also gains <strong>advantage </strong>on <strong>attack </strong>rolls in the <strong>first round</strong> of combat.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the<strong> Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>less than 5 </strong>suffers <strong>disadvantage </strong>on all<strong> saving throws</strong> in the<strong> first round</strong> of combat.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong> gives their enemies <strong>advantage </strong>on <strong>attack</strong> rolls in the<strong> first round</strong> of combat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the heroes advance through <strong>Zone 5</strong>, they move into the encounter area, where combat takes place.

Blinking lights and flashing monitors indicate that the station is obviously in constant communication with someone, and displays show sensor readouts from around the station and elsewhere on <strong>Felucia</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Lieutenant Aden</h4>\n<p><strong>Lieutenant Aden</strong> is a young officer who believes that he is on the rise in the Empire. Unfortunately, he’s sadly mistaken. His posting to the backwater world of <strong>Felucia </strong>is meant to keep him out of the way, just as the secret facility is intended to keep prisoners hidden. <strong>Lt. Aden</strong> has delusions of grandeur, but he is a violent and ill-tempered man who thinks he has something to prove. A number of commanders transferred him out of their units after he decided to demonstrate his loyalty to the Empire by berating fellow officers for even the smallest offense. Loud and angry,<strong> Lt. Aden </strong>would like nothing more than to kill some rebellious scum and earn a promotion off of <strong>Felucia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[WCRXdvN6yk1peKMj]{Lieutenant Aden}</strong></p>\n<h4>Lt. Aden’s Tactics</h4>\n<p><strong>Lt. Aden’s</strong> zeal sometimes gets the best of him, especially in combat. He activates his <strong>Leadership </strong>ability as often as possible and fights more aggressively than most Imperial officers. Though he seeks cover when possible, <strong>Lt. Aden</strong> takes a shot at the heroes each <strong>round</strong>, even if it exposes him to their attacks.</p>\n<h4>Imperial Comm Operator</h4>\n<p>Each <strong>Imperial communications officer</strong> is a trained soldier first and foremost. Drawn from the ranks of the Imperial Army, these<strong> comm operators</strong> are capable of defending the<strong> prison facility</strong> as well as any other soldier. The operators are in charge of ensuring that communications continue to flow across <strong>Felucia </strong>and to the <strong>Star Destroyer </strong>in orbit, and all are entrusted with a higher level of security clearance, allowing them to convey secret messages to their superiors.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>This Imperial soldier wears a dark gray uniform and an Imperial Army helmet, and a blaster pistol is holstered at his hip.

Aden </strong>does. They seek cover behind the computer equipment in the room and attempt to use their blaster pistols at a decent range to drive the heroes back. The <strong>comm operators</strong> are good shots with their blaster pistols, and they try to hunker down and the keep the heroes from taking advantage of cover as well.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the encounter concludes, the heroes can access the Imperial network (as described under “<strong>@JournalEntry[FidowQN2ThLQT5yx]{P3: Communications Center}</strong>”). Additionally, they can recover <strong>Lt. Aden’s code cylinder</strong>, which allows them to use the turbolifts in the common area of the ground floor, granting them access to the <strong>command center</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes agreed to plant the explosives given to them by <strong>Vazus Mandrake</strong>, they may do so in this room. As long as all of the Imperials have been defeated, the heroes are under <strong>no time pressure</strong> to set the charges. If they successfully plant the explosives in the<strong> communications center</strong>, grant them experience points as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 3 enemy</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Features of the Area</h4>\n<p>The walls of this room are lined with computer consoles, each featuring different communications arrays. Although the consoles provide no special terrain effects, any <strong>comm operator</strong> can use them to send a message to the <strong>command center </strong>that there are intruders in the facility. Doing so requires a <strong>comm operator </strong>to make a successful <strong>Technology check</strong> as an <strong>action</strong> on one of the consoles. If such a message is sent, at the conclusion of combat the heroes can attempt to cancel the alert by similarly using the <strong>communications arrays</strong> and making a successful <strong>Deception check</strong> against <strong>Captain Vischera</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/tiles/Communications%20Center.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"486\" /></p>","folder":"NIv6HkZv2u8T9iaX","sort":800000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Most of these NPCs can simply be names with a species and a personality attached, because their statistics will not matter for the challenges in this adventure. However, <strong>five gamblers</strong> should be of particular interest to the players. Over the course of the <strong>tournament,</strong> these competitors should stand out as exceptional players and beings of interest. Any one of them could be <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>, though one—<strong>Koroma Moro</strong>—is a bit less suspect because he is known to be in <strong>Switch’s</strong> employ. Before the tournament ends, the players should have gathered enough information to narrow down the possibilities a bit.</p>\n</section>\n<h3>Creeska</h3>\n<p><strong>Creeska</strong> is a Rodian gambler who has made a name for himself as an exceptionally aggressive competitor. Though he is friendly—and surprisingly likable, for a Rodian—he never wants to back down from a bluff and has used his gambling muscle to intimidate his opponents into making mistakes. <strong>Creeska</strong> wears a bulky jacket made of Krayt dragon leather and is quite generous in sharing his winnings with others in the casino.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><strong>Creeska</strong> is also a cheater and should provide a chance for players working as <strong>security guards</strong> to catch him cheating on the <strong>final day </strong>of the tournament.

{"_id":"STkMJygJi71IKB1v","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em> is the second adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e</strong></em> experience. This adventure lets the heroes delve deeper into the mysterious plot surrounding former Imperial <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, and the heroes should advance to<strong> 5th level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes get to see what the galaxy is like in the wake of the rise of the Empire, and they discover a bit more about the Empire’s secret plans and how they involve a Hutt crime lord named <strong>Darga</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Background</h2>\n<p>This adventure is designed under the assumption that you have run your heroes through the first <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> adventure, <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>. The heroes should already be acquainted with <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, <strong>Captain Sirona Okeefe</strong>, and <strong>Captain Adrian Verana</strong> of the Alderaanian starship <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. Beyond that, the heroes need to know only that there is much to be gained in working for <strong>Bail Organa</strong>, even indirectly, and that the Galactic Empire is up to something big.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t running <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> but would like to use this adventure in your home campaign, the heroes might be hired by an existing NPC in your campaign to investigate the dealings that a Hutt crime lord has with the Empire. They can try to discover what the Empire is trading with the Hutt and report back to their employer.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is highly recommended that you read the entire adventure thoroughly before running it. Some of the events can take place at varying times, and having full knowledge of the potential events can save you many headaches.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Summary</h4>\n<p>At a briefing aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> explains that part of his responsibility in a secret Imperial scheme known as the <strong>Sarlacc Project </strong>was to arrange the covert exchange of resources through a Hutt crime lord on the planet <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> orders the heroes to travel aboard <strong>Captain Okeefe’s </strong>transport to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, make contact with <strong>Darga</strong>, the Hutt gangster, and discover what he’s trading with the Empire.</p>\n<p>First, the heroes must find one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>underlings—a Devaronian named <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>—at a ruined warehouse. Though <strong>Raden </strong>does not wish to help them, the heroes must convince him to lead them to a hidden location in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>. The building is in fact <strong>Darga </strong>the Hutt’s <strong>palace</strong>, which the crime lord took over after its previous Neimoidian inhabitant (a high-ranking member of the Trade Federation) vanished, leaving it abandoned. The heroes enter the <strong>palace </strong>and are granted an audience with the Hutt. <strong>Darga </strong>has ordered them brought to him so that he can size them up, and he offers to let the heroes stay in his court for a few days, giving them a chance to impress him and gain his trust.</p>\n<p>The heroes stay in the <strong>palace’s</strong> <strong>guest quarters</strong>. During the final night of their stay, any <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive characters begin to hear whispers, as though someone were trying to communicate with them telepathically, and they feel a tugging in the <strong>Force</strong> toward one of the other rooms. Following the whispers, they discover a secret set of chambers below the guest quarters. Inside is a comatose woman, older and gray with weathered features, who is hooked up to machinery that is keeping her unconscious. Once the heroes revive her, they discover that she is a former Jedi Master named <strong>Denia </strong>who has been kept comatose ever since she fell in battle during the Clone Wars. Unfortunately, the heroes’ meddling hasn’t gone unnoticed, and <strong>Darga </strong>calls the<strong> palace guards</strong>, leaving the entire building in an uproar.</p>\n<p>As the heroes fight their way back to the upper levels of <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, they quickly discover that the Hutt is living up to his species’ reputation for cowardice. Terrified at the prospect of having a Jedi loose in his <strong>palace</strong>, <strong>Darga</strong> flees to his space yacht and takes off for the planet <strong>Bespin</strong>. Though the Hutt leaves town in a hurry, his minions remain behind to try to finish off the intruders.</p>\n<h2>Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[LaGGHuPsaCPKi8uT]{Opening Crawl}</strong></p>","folder":"DUb0crJ7IJjaqUGJ","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"Sm7SseN7GvTtyP7P","name":"2-03 Gladiator Match","content":"<h2>Gladiator Match</h2>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>The heroes and the opposing gladiators begin the encounter on opposite sides of the <strong>gladiator arena.</strong> The <strong>three Gamorrean gladiators</strong> set up close by one another (though far enough apart to be difficult to hit with <strong>stun grenades</strong> and <strong>Force powers</strong>) while the <strong>Rodian</strong> and the <strong>droid</strong> set up much farther away. The heroes may arrange themselves in any position they wish, but they should be close to the wall farthest from the other gladiators.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>Just before the battle with <strong>Darga’s gladiators</strong> begins, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>High above the gladiator pit, Darga the Hutt presides over the beginning of the match, looking down on you with a slimy grin. Standing just to his left is the protocol droid translator, who relays the Hutt’s decree down to you: “Fight for the chance to be my personal gladiator team! Riches and fame for all who are strong enough to seize them!” With that, the Hutt blows a massive horn that echoes throughout the open gladiator pit. Dirt crunches underfoot, and flickering light shines on you from the lamps mounted around the perimeter.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Gladiators</h4>\n<p><strong>Darga </strong>has a crop of interesting and dangerous gladiators, culled from the ranks of his previous teams and as eclectic as they come. The <strong>Karg brothers</strong> are three Gamorreans who may or may not really be brothers; no one has dared investigate the claim further. They specialize in melee combat, wielding extremely deadly <em>vibro-axes,</em> but they use <em>energy balls</em> as ranged weapons. The Rodian gladiator <strong>Zayda</strong> is an exile from his homeworld who tried his hand at bounty hunting before realizing that he just wanted to blast people for a living. His personal combat droid assistant, <strong>RX-7246,</strong> is a custom-made battle droid with an extensive library of heavy weapon combat routines. These five gladiators have already survived <strong>several rounds</strong> in the arena against other opponents and are eager to prove themselves against the heroes.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The five gladiators are an odd mix, making a team that seems as mismatched as it is diverse. Three Gamorreans wielding vibro-axes snort and drool hungrily, pounding on their armored chests and looking as though they were preparing for a feast. A sly-looking Rodian paces back and forth casually, gripping a blaster at his hip, clenching and unclenching his fist as he waits for the fight to start. A cobbled-together battle droid with three photoreceptors and a massive grenade launcher stands stock still, its only movement the occasional twitch of an electronic eye swiveling to examine you from a different angle.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>3 @Actor[moEVarSUbXL1kL2z]{Karg Brothers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[rZKkZVBNIjx0W66V]{RX-7246}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[odrt0PZl42HJ8g5B]{Zayda}</strong></p>\n<h4>Gladiator Tactics</h4>\n<p>The gladiators are willing to adhere to <strong>Darga’s </strong>decree that <em>stun weapons</em> be used in lieu of blaster bolts. The <strong>Karg Brothers</strong> are disappointed that they are not allowed to deal killing blows, and if they down a hero, they try to make sure he stays down if they can do so surreptitiously. <strong>RX-7246</strong> opens with <em>stun grenades,</em> hoping to knock a hero or two down the condition track so that the Karg brothers can carve them up more easily. If at least two gladiators are knocked unconscious, or if all of the gladiators fall below half their <strong>hit points,</strong> they are angered and cast aside <strong>Darga’s </strong>decree, setting their weapons to fire normally. <strong>RX-7246</strong> switches to <em>frag grenades</em> at this point, and <strong>Zayda</strong> retreats to make <strong>ranged attacks</strong>. The <strong>Karg brothers’</strong> tactics do not change.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note from the Foundry Conversion Team:</strong> In <em><strong>SW5E,</strong></em> there are no specific rules for stun settings on weapons. There doesn't need to be, as a character using an appropriate weapon can decide whether they did lethal or non-lethal damage when they drop a foe. What this means is that the moment where a character decides, mechanically, that they are using a 'stun setting' doesn't necessarily line up with the moment where the gladiators decide to stop using them inside the fictional framework of this fight. This is okay. You can describe the enemy switching off stun even though they aren't at the point of delivering a killing blow. While that might not have a mechanical effect, from a story standpoint, it clearly declares their intentions. If they are firing deadly blaster bolts in defiance of Darga's decree, it's obvious they've <em>already</em> decided the fate of any PC they reduce to zero HP.  While they technically make the decision when they drop their foe, there's no rule against making the call early and sticking to it.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>If the heroes survive and win the match, they are congratulated by <strong>Darga</strong>, who also awards them <strong>1,000 credits’</strong> worth of jewels. Since the heroes have likely depleted many resources (including <strong>hit points),</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>agrees to end the session of his court for the day, allowing the heroes to retire to their rooms and recuperate.</p>\n<p>If the heroes lose the match, the Hutt bestows honors upon his gladiators and does not end the day’s session in court. If any hero decides to go to the guest chambers to recuperate, <strong>Darga </strong>continues on without him or her. Feel free to let that hero have a solo encounter with <strong>Six-Six</strong> or the moneychanger so that his or her time away from the court is not wasted.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[CPlxKk2iBUxOCmbG]{The Moneychanger}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[IzRPQKyF46Doyn4B]{A Visit from Six-Six}</strong></p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Gladiator_match.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"789\" /></p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"tGyRjO9FvMNYmhSK","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

This adventure begins the third act of the campaign, which consists of three adventures: The Gem of Alderaan, Sword of the Empire, and Jaws of the Sarlacc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>About six months have passed since the last adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will infiltrate a high society gala, play high-stakes games of sabacc, and fight alongside Imperial stormtroopers to defend against hijackers bent on capturing a train full of dignitaries. The heroes should start The Gem of Alderaan at 15th level and reach 17th level by the conclusion. With some modifications, this adventure can also be used as a stand-alone scenario or as part of your existing campaign.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IS DAWN OF DEFIANCE?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dawn of Defiance is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the adventures in the Dawn of Defiance campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic SW5e experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The Dawn of Defiance campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Dawn of Defiance adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Warning! If you will be playing in a Dawn of Defiance campaign or in a campaign utilizing its adventures, read no further.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CAMPAIGN UPDATE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Six months pass from the end of A Reckoning of Wraiths to the beginning of the final story arc of the Dawn of Defiance campaign. During this time, Bail Organa keeps the heroes safe from scrutiny while they continue to search for Master Denia. Following the destruction of the Resurgence, both Master Denia and Inquisitor Draco vanished without a trace and have not been seen or heard from since.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bail Organa walks a fine line in the Imperial Senate. Admiral Varth— whose true allegiance was revealed at the end of the last adventure— knows that Organa has been engaging in seditious actions, but he cannot bring the Senator to trial without revealing the existence of the Sarlacc Project, which he is loath to do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the heroes are now considered enemies of the Empire. They have death marks on their heads, and only Senator Organa’s protection keeps them from being captured or killed by bounty hunters and Imperial agents. The need to keep a low profile complicates their task of finding Denia and the prototype Super Star Destroyer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If desired, you can use this gap to run your own adventures as the heroes follow leads and avoid the authorities, helping the PCs achieve 15th level before starting The Gem of Alderaan. The heroes might learn about their death marks the hard way after encountering determined bounty hunters. They might fight their way out of trouble, alter their wanted postings to include faulty information (such as “Last seen on Bespin”), or get their postings moved down the priority list (perhaps by faking the appearance of an even more notorious criminal). They might accomplish this by slicing into computer systems, planting rumors, or gaining the assistance of a crime lord or corrupt law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUMMARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After months of searching, Bail Organa finally learns that the Empire has taken Jedi Master Denia to the planet Prakith in the Deep Core, a fortress world that serves as the base of operations for the Inquisitorius. It is virtually impossible to travel to Praxis without Imperial security clearance, and the background check necessary to obtain clearance would reveal that the heroes have death marks on their heads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, Senator Organa has discovered that Lady Alya Aldrete—an Alderaanian heiress known for her decadent behavior—has access to security clearances, using them so smugglers in her employ can ferry forbidden goods to and from the heavily secured Deep Core worlds. To have a chance to speak with her, the heroes must attend the maiden voyage of the Gem of Alderaan, a luxury repulsortrain that is a part of her family’s collection of resorts, casinos, and passenger liners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the PCs arrive at the launch station, stormtroopers line the perimeter as Imperial officers mill about with the Alderaanian nobles. The maiden voyage will last several hours, during which time the heroes must make a good impression through a series of social encounters: playing sabacc in the casino, rubbing shoulders with nobles at a fancy dinner, holding intelligent conversation in the lounge, and even engaging in recreation in the onboard nightclub.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eventually, the heroes gain the notice of Lady Aldrete’s personal assistant, a Twi’lek named Notru’denn, who summons them to her private traincar. He reveals that his employer’s appearance as a self-centered noble is just a cover for her clandestine activities. In truth, Lady Aldrete uses her Deep Core smugglers as spies, creating an information network that spans the galaxy. If the heroes convince Notru’denn of their sincerity, he offers to arrange an audience with Lady Aldrete as soon as she returns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Moments later, the repulsortrain lurches and alarms sound. Trandoshan mercenaries hijack the train, hold the passengers hostage in the control car, and will release them only if Senator Organa surrenders. (They saw Organa on the guest list and think that the Senator is on board.) The heroes fight the first group of mercenaries in a dark nightclub, using their wits to overcome their relative lack of weapons. Pushing into the casino car, they find an Imperial dignitary and his stormtroopers fighting more mercenaries and a heavily armed war droid. Working with their unlikely allies, the heroes storm the dining car (filled with hostages) to rescue the last large cluster of guests onboard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes move forward through the observation car, they are attacked by the mercenaries’ starfighters, which seem intent on destroying the car. The heroes uncouple the trailing cars to protect the civilians on board, then fight the starfighters, outgunned by their powerful weapons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes finally reach the control car, they find the Trandoshan mercenary commander using Lady Aldrete as a human shield. He drags her up to the roof, where the final showdown takes place as the out-of-control repulsortrain speeds hundreds of meters above a snowcovered mountain range. After the heroes defeat the Trandoshan and rescue Lady Aldrete, Captain Sirona Okeefe’s transport swoops down to scoop them up as the train careens into the mountains below. They blast their way past the mercenary transport and return to Senator Organa to negotiate with Lady Aldrete, moving one step closer to saving Master Denia and stopping the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OPENING CRAWL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS : DAWN OF DEFIANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Episode VIII: The Gem of Alderaan</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After months of searching, the heroes finally learn that Jedi Master Denia is being held captive on a fortress world in the Deep Core.

When they arrive, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senator Organa calls you into his office and waits for the door to close. “It has taken some time, but I believe I have found Master Denia’s whereabouts.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He activates a holoprojector, creating the hovering image of a planet. “This is Prakith, a fortress world in the Deep Core. The Inquisitorius uses it as a base of operations, and my sources indicate that Inquisitor Draco brought Master Denia here after the destruction of the Resurgence. If the past is any indication, Draco will try to break her—it is only a matter of time.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The image zooms out, showing Prakith as one world in a tight cluster of countless stars. “The Deep Core is almost impossible to travel without recent astrogational data, and only ships with proper clearance can download it. Worse, the Empire heavily patrols these spacelanes, and only ships with the proper clearance codes are allowed to pass.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, getting this clearance requires an extensive background check by Imperial Intelligence. In your case—well, let’s just say a death mark would catch their attention. But even with no marks on your record, it could take months. And that is time that Master Denia just doesn’t have.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At this point, give the heroes a chance to ask a few questions. Use the following as guidelines for Senator Organa’s responses:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How much time do we have? “My sources intercepted a transmission from Draco’s superiors. From what they could decode, it appears that the Inquisitorius is growing impatient with Master Denia’s resistance to interrogation. Draco is almost certainly escalating to more brutal techniques, and it is only a matter of time before he breaks her—or kills her in the attempt. She is strong, but she probably has days, not weeks.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why are the codes so important? “Due to its astrography, the Deep Core has a very limited number of viable hyperspace routes in and out, and a ship’s captain can’t even download the necessary astrogational charts without proper clearance. Since the routes are so limited in number, the Empire can easily patrol them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Can we try to plot a new hyperspace route that the Empire doesn’t know about? “Plotting new hyperspace routes is a very dangerous and long process, taking weeks or months even under the best of circumstances. In the Deep Core, with so many stars clustered so closely together, the process would be even slower, and the chances of a catastrophic failure are much, much higher.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Could we hire a transport that already has these codes? “Possibly, but seats fill up quickly, so it would take weeks or months to get there this way. Even if we chartered a private transport, it would take some time to find one willing to risk carrying high-profile fugitives into or out of the Deep Core. “</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Is there anyone who could give us the codes? “Yes. I have found one good lead . . .” (Continue with the boxed text below.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After any questions have been answered, continue by reading or paraphrasing the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Fortunately, I believe I have found someone who already has this Deep Core clearance.” The holoprojector brings up the image of a stunning young woman wearing a luxurious but revealing gown. “This is Lady Alya Aldrete, heiress to the Aldrete family empire of luxury hotels, casinos, passenger liners, and other playgrounds for the idle rich. Alya herself uses her family name and fortune to pursue a life of decadence and excess, making herself into a celebrity and icon while the gossip media watches her every move. This is a problem for us because I need you to meet her.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I have reason to believe that, among her other contacts, she has a cadre of personal smugglers who ferry illegal spice, stolen artwork, and other illicit luxuries. Every indication is that she has access to several clearance codes that would provide authorization for travel in the Deep Core. If Master Denia is to have any hope of rescue, we need to talk Lady Aldrete into helping us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Her love of media attention will make this very difficult. We can’t have you being recorded speaking with her, or you’ll attract scrutiny—and it wouldn’t take an investigative reporter long to discover your status as wanted criminals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But we do have a unique opportunity to get close to her without being surrounded by holorecorders. The Gem of Alderaan, a luxury repulsortrain owned by her family, is going to be launched on its maiden voyage tomorrow night. Alya is holding an invitationonly launch party, which will give you a chance to speak with her without attracting undue attention. As a senator, my office is routinely sent invitations to such events as a matter of courtesy. I’m giving you the invitations so you can appear on my behalf, disguised as advisors and aides for my senate office.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gala is certain to have a significant Imperial presence. You will have to go in with little more than the clothes on your backs, and you will not have much time to build a respectable cover story to ensure that security does not hassle you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once on board, you can expect Lady Aldrete to be surrounded by a gaggle of hangers-on at any given moment. Our topic absolutely cannot be brought up in front of witnesses, and she’s unlikely to grant an audience to total strangers. Instead, you must somehow attract her interest so she will extend an invitation to you, and the best way to do that is by befriending or impressing as many high-profile guests as possible. Get them talking about you, and eventually she will seek you out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let me put it another way: You have 24 hours to prepare your background and learn about the guests well enough to blend in with nobles, politicians, celebrities, and Imperials in close quarters on a luxury repulsortrain, all the while making a good impression and attracting the attention of a flighty celebrity heiress so that you can ask her, in private, to provide proper codes for illegally infiltrating the Deep Core. Any questions?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Give the heroes a final opportunity to ask follow-up questions, using the following guidelines to determine Senator Organa’s response.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why us? Why not you or some other agent? “A senator being seen meeting privately with a ‘celebutante’ would make for scandalous headlines, drawing unwanted attention. New faces generating a lot of buzz among high-profile guests should be more than enough to get her attention.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What should we do to set up our false identities? “Whatever aliases you pick for yourselves, my office can create basic matching identification that shows you to be senior aides in my senate office, living in an on-site dormitory. This will pass casual inspection but not a check of electronic records. It would be best if you could fabricate a bit of history and plant records that make you seem legitimate.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How do we learn about the guests? “The launch of the Gem of Alderaan is a major event, so you can find press releases and news items about those in attendance. Start by searching local computer networks and news feeds. Since the event is happening just over a day from now, many guests have already arrived, so you might be able to pick up names by asking around, particularly in the lounges of upscale hotels in Aldera.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What will security be like? “Expect security to be very tight. Other than very simple, common devices—comlinks, credit chips, datapads, recorders, and the like— don’t expect to be able to bring any significant tools or equipment. It will be very difficult to smuggle all but the smallest and simplest of weapons on board.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes are ready, Senator Organa sends them on their way with the invitations, their new identification cards, and 10,000 credits for new clothes, bribes, tips, or other expenses. He strongly recommends that the heroes save as much as possible for the launch itself, spending and tipping generously to reinforce their image. (If possible, the heroes should also bring their own money to supplement this amount.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes now have about 24 hours before the launch, which they can spend in any way they wish. Two tasks that will make their job much easier are finding out details about the guest list—particularly highprofile guests—and preparing a solid, inspection-worthy background for their assumed identities. The heroes can address these tasks in whatever order they prefer, and they can even be undertaken simultaneously.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE GUEST LIST</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the guest list for this invitation-only gala isn’t a secret, it isn’t publicized, either. Finding the necessary details requires a little legwork.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: Six different channels can provide information about the guest list, but no one approached supplies the entire list. Out of the six, the heroes must successfully complete four to get the entire guest list. They do not have to be done in order, and the heroes can split up and attempt multiple channels simultaneously if they wish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the players describe what they want their character's to do in order to compile the guest list then call for ability checks appropriate to what they are doing. Do not inform the players if they succeed or fail at these checks and as they progress, feel free to add threats, opportunities or play off conflicts caused by player actions. Sample check's are listed below. Additionally a player suggest using a class feature or power instead of making a check, if it makes sense allow it to count as an automatic success when tallying how successful they were.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hero can ask around, finding taxi drivers, club patrons, and hotel visitors who have spotted notable out-of-town guests that have been seen in the area. Have the players make a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A search of computer networks can uncover press conferences, articles, and other pieces that identify individuals attending the gala. Have the players make a DC 24 Intelligence (Technology) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A brief search turns up a nighttime desk clerk who is short on cash, and the hero can bribe him to provide a list of attendees staying at his hotel. Have the players bribe the desk clerk with an amount of credits you deem appropriate and make a DC 23 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pretending to be a hurried or confused attendee unable to locate a group of friends, the hero can fast-talk a concierge into revealing other passengers. Have the players make a DC 22 Charisma (Deception) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hero can stake out the hotel district with a pair of electrobinoculars to try to identify notables and their entourages. Have the players make a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Only possible between 12:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. The hero can sneak into restricted areas of the repulsortrain station to find unsecured passenger information. Have the players make a DC 24 Dexterity (Stealth) check</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do not succeed in getting the entire list, they can still learn some useful information:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1 success: The heroes learn the total number of attendees (107) and the identity of one major guest. Choose the guest randomly from the “Who’s Who” textbox.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2 successes: As above, but with the identity of two major guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3 successes: As above, but with the identity of three major guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: If the heroes know the identity of one or more major guests, they can attempt to learn specific details about a particular guest’s interests, likes, and dislikes. (This makes later social interaction somewhat easier.) Consider the following sample checks or make your own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Searching public data sources is the simplest approach. Have the players make a DC 21 Intelligence (Technology) check</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Appealing to the least common denominator—or telling someone what they want to hear—can influence those close to the guests to talk about what they know. Have the players make a DC 22 Charisma (Deception) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tail your target to profile his or her actions and interests, using your skills to blend in with the crowd and avoid detection. Have the players make a DC 24 Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any ability check fails by 5 or more, that guest’s security detail becomes aware that someone is paying too much attention to their charge. The resulting lockdown makes it impossible to make any further attempts to learn about that guest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: Once the heroes have exhausted all leads, run out of time, or given up, move on to the next part of the adventure. Learning details about a major guest gives the heroes advantage on all Deception, Persuasion, and Perception checks involving that guest in Part 2: Getting to Know You.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MAKING A NAME FOR YOURSELF</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: In addition to learning about the guests at the launch gala, the heroes need to build a plausible cover that allows them to fit in. While the IDs and invitations provided by Senator Organa are a good start, no records exist to match the new identities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To create, edit, or delete publicly available government records, the heroes must gain authorized access to a government database so that they can insert their information into official records. The computer system in question is operated by a local public safety office.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To be treated as an authorized user and gain the ability to alter public records, the heroes must make a DC 24 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check. A failure by 5 or more draws the attention of a low-level administrator who makes additional checks at this computer be made at disadvantage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can make this task simpler if they choose a good target for their efforts, using either or both of the skills below. Each check can be attempted only once.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A determined search of isolated computer networks finds a more publicly accessible system. A successful DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check lowers the the slicer's kit check to a DC 20.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Familiarity with similar security systems can provide insight on the verification protocols, potentially providing a back door to easy access. A successful DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check grants advantage to checks involving these computer systems.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHO'S WHO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When researching the guest list, the heroes can learn about several major guests who are attending the maiden voyage of the Gem of Alderaan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MAJOR GUESTS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes learn the name, occupation, and physical description of any major guest they have identified. Other details (personality, interests, and pursuits) become available if the heroes successfully research an individual guest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Morrax Nabin: Imperial governor. Old Human male, graying hair, brown eyes, mustache. Thoughtful, shy, and brilliant, he enjoys playing simultaneous games of holochess with different colleagues (including, at times, the Emperor), relaying moves through short messages over a period of weeks or months. He is always accompanied by an elite stormtrooper bodyguard detail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lynaa: Fashion designer. Middle-aged Twi’lek female, blue skin, brown eyes. Gregarious, flamboyant, and eccentric, she regularly does charity work for wildlife conservation groups. She is never without her purebred voorpak, Taezii, a tiny fluffy animal that fits in the pockets of Lynaa’s robes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dien Suub: SoroSuub executive. Old Sullustan male, brown eyes, tan skin, plump build. Friendly, pragmatic, and driven, he reads the entire front section of the Brentaal Trade News every morning over breakfast.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Zalar Rishek: Scion of the House of Rishek. Adult Human male, blond hair, gray eyes. Arrogant, spoiled, and overbearing, he races customized airspeeders, swoops, and star yachts when he’s not busy chasing romantic prospects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cednah Faenel: Alderaanian noblewoman. Venerable Human female, silver hair, hazel eyes. Quiet, gracious, and generous, her lifetime love of dance led her to donate millions to renovate the Grand Theater in Belleau-a-Lir. Her family’s lands include the Faenel Vineyard, home to an exquisite Alderaanian brandy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ardia Terrsyn: Actress. Adult Human female, long braided black hair, dark skin, green eyes. Inquisitive, insightful, and savvy, she acquired a taste for sabacc after studying it for a role in a holodrama about a Hutt crime family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MINOR GUESTS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are over one hundred guests on board, far too many to list and describe. Use the following names and descriptions to fill in other characters as needed during the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Khyyynett (middle-age male Wookiee, musician)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Prof. Wachs Tauph (old male Bothan, university chancellor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dyni Endarsin (young adult female Zeltron, artist)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr. Hakaen Bousch (old male Mon Calamari, physician)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr. Stae-Fahnti Koelbayr (middle-age male Human, commentator)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tavid Ahkoeri (old male Human, gambler)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Capt. Z’paul Diin (old male Duros, explorer)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Brial Sullor (adult female Human, novelist)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anjeru Valett (middle-age male Human, attorney)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ruf-Asti-Viarffli (old male Cerean, president of Dohnia free colony)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mahg-Raet Duumont (old female Herglic, financier)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fia Nazhena (adult female Cathar, heiress).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the players gain access, they must provide records for their new identities, either by fabricating them or by linking each hero’s identity with another person’s name and history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A hero can find a good candidate for a “borrowed” identity by making a DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A hero can create a complete identity—including tax records, employment history, educational background, and so forth—by making a DC 23 Intelligence check to correctly complete all necessary records. If a player is proficient in forgery kits, allow them to add their proficiency to the roll.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the proper records have been created or appropriated for the heroes’ identities, each hero must prepare a disguise—dress, mannerisms, and perhaps stage makeup and prosthetics. If done properly, each disguise fits the hero’s fabricated or borrowed background and “sells” the persona.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Players can create a disguise themselves with use of a DC 18 Intelligence (disguise kit) check or a DC 20 Intelligence (Deception) check. If they fail, the disguise will raise scrutiny with security at the gala but do not tell players if they fail. Enterprising players may attempt to use a power, class feature or item to circumvent the use of a disguise but unless it can hold up to physical inspection, it will automatically fail and give away the player's lie. Unless the players already has an appropriately wealthy wardrobe (unlikely for anyone other than a noble or officer), crafting the disguise costs 1,000 credits for each hero.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: Even without completing these steps, the basic identification and invitations provided by Senator Organa are sufficient to get any given hero on board the Gem of Alderaan. However, having incomplete backgrounds or “thin” identities can cause some difficulties during the social encounters in Part 2: Getting to Know You.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OTHER PREPERATIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the more important tasks outlined in the following sections, the heroes must take care of several mundane preparations before appearing at the launch gala for the Gem of Alderaan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SLEEP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Because of the high pace of the work, the heroes will burn out if they work for more than eight hours. For every additional hour worked without getting eight hours of sleep, a character must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw with the DC increasing by 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHOPPING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The players can purchase legal, unenhanced equipment with relative ease, it is impossible to find a vendor or seller for enhanced items.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONTRABAND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes might wish to spend time figuring a way to smuggle equipment or weapons onto the Gem of Alderaan. If a character asks about security or carrying restricted items on board, have her make an Intelligence (Technology) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 13: Other than communications devices, computers/storage devices, and recording units, very few items are authorized to be carried on board by non-Imperial personnel. It is a relatively short trip, so guests are not expected to bring overnight luggage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 16: Security at the event will probably include passing through a sophisticated weapons scanner as well as a check of the passenger’s identification and invitation. If a passenger’s identification is not supported by electronic records, that passenger will attract greater scrutiny.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 19: Contraband can be smuggled past security, either by planting it on authorized personnel who bypass the scanners or by disguising it as part of a legitimate device. (Ordinary concealment is useless against a weapons scanner.) In either case, the smuggled item must be very small, meaning that larger items must be carefully disassembled into smaller parts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a player wishes to smuggle contraband onboard the Gem of Alderaan, use the sample checks for inspiration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disassembling Items: An object that would be comparable up medium size can be broken down into tiny sized components with a DC 15 tool check appropriate to the object (A techblade for example would be broken down by armstech's tools) and takes one hour. If the check fails by more than 5, the object is damaged and unusable until repaired. In order to repair an object a DC 15 tool check appropriate to the object must be made and also takes an hour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Reassembly requires the same check as disassembling with the same consequences for a failed check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disguising Items Any object to be smuggled through security must be disguised as part of one or more innocuous devices, such as comlinks or datapads. Objects that are not of tiny size cannot be smuggled in and must be disassembled first.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disguising an object is a difficult deception, requiring one hour and a DC 23 Intelligence (Deception) check made with disadvantage or a DC 23 Intelligence (disguise kit) check. If they fail, the disguised objects will raise scrutiny with security at the gala but do not tell players if they fail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Planting Items: A player may attempt make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to hide or retrieve broken down objects or other contraband on security personnel or guests. The guards and guests are decently observant but any skilled pickpocket can easily fool them however if a check fails by more than 5, they are caught in the act.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MOVING ON</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes finish their preparations, or when they run out of time, move on to Part 2: Getting to Know You.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: GETTING TO KNOW YOU</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The launch gala for the Gem of Alderaan has arrived, and the heroes find themselves walking the red carpet with celebrities, politicians, philanthropists, famed artists, and brilliant scholars.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The launch gala takes place in what looks like a luxurious banquet hall. You see chandeliers hand-carved by artisans on Naboo, floors and columns carved from exquisite Chandrilan sun marble, and an atrium leading to a priceless Mon Calamari water sculpture, held aloft by miniature repulsor fields and flowing like an waterfall that feeds itself, subtly evolving and shifting in its perpetual motion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But this isn’t a resort, a hotel, or a banquet hall. It’s a repuslortrain station—one unlike any in the galaxy—and the elite from dozens of worlds have gathered to see the maiden voyage of the Gem of Alderaan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are in line, approaching the security checkpoint. If a player wants to engage a fellow guest in conversation, use one of the minor guests from the Who’s Who textbox. Give the heroes a chance to try out their new identities, but in a matter of minutes, they will have to break off the conversation to deal with security.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RECEPTION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before making it into the reception itself, the heroes must contend with security. If all heroes have complete identities (as described in Making a Name for Yourself) and they aren’t attempting to smuggle contraband, the security checkpoint is uneventful. If this is not the case, there might be some complications.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SECURITY SCREENING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The security checkpoint is run by one supervisor and four security screeners. Two screeners operate a stationary weapons scanner which penetrate all cover and illusions when attempting to detect objects passing through it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players have complete identities and perfect disguises, they pass through the checkpoint without issue.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However if any player does not having a complete identity or has a disguise that did not meet the DC earlier, the supervisor takes an interest in that player's screening and discovers a flaw which prompts all players to go through an intensive screening instead unless they can make a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check to play off the flaws in their identities or disguises.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An intensive screening will result in any disguised objects being found and confiscated as contraband.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: Because of their personal invitations and IDs linking them to the office of Senator Organa, the heroes are virtually guaranteed to be allowed on board after the screeners confiscate any contraband they find. The real challenge is to avoid making a scene in front of the other guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIFE OF THE PARTY.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This section of the adventure is entirely social encounters, there are DCs for many ability checks but if you wish to make the parties actions mean more, modify the DCs as appropriate depending on how the Gala's attendants view the party.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Attitude DC Modifier</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hostile +10</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unfriendly +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Indifferent +2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Friendly +0</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Helpful -2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These modifiers override any individual attitudes. For example if a character is friendly towards the players but the Gala attendants are unfriendly with them, then the friendly character is treated as unfriendly due to them not wanting to be associated with the party at that moment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before improving the Gala attendants attitude to make them view the party as helpful the heroes must improve the attitude of at least one major guest to helpful, and the number of helpful major guests must be greater than the number of major guests with an attitude of unfriendly or worse.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Similarly, group attitude cannot worsen to hostile unless at least one major guest has an attitude of hostile, and the number of hostile major guests is greater than the number of major guests with an attitude of friendly or better.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the party has learned specific details about all of the major guests inside a particular encounter, they gain advantage on all social checks involving those guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once they join the gala, the heroes need to make a good first impression by being witty, charming, and pleasant. Failing that, they must at least avoid a faux pas by staying quiet without appearing standoffish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This section of the adventure is entirely social encounters, there are sample DCs for many ability checks but you should modify them as appropriate depending on how the group</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: The most important objective in this scene is to make a good first impression with the guests as a whole. If the players passed through the scanners without issue, the Gala attendants are indifferent to them however if they were subject to intensive screening the Gala attendants are instead unfriendly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over the course of the reception, each hero must attempt two social interactions with other guests. In addition, the group as a whole must attempt two additional interactions, which can be undertaken by any of the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The result of the reception is determined by the number of social interactions that have an unpleasant outcome (for example, saying something embarrassing, accidentally insulting someone, or perhaps trying too hard).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes have 0 to 2 unpleasant interactions, the reception is a smashing success. The heroes make a positive and lasting impression on the entire group, improving group attitude by one step (from indifferent to friendly, for example).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes have 3 to 5 unpleasant interactions, the reactions are mixed and, on balance, largely neutral. Group attitude does not improve or worsen as a result.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes have 6 or more unpleasant interactions, the reception is a disaster. The other guests come to the conclusion that the heroes are unrefined, uncouth, and ill-mannered, and they are subject to icy stares and derisive laughter from all in attendance. Group attitude worsens by one step (from indifferent to unfriendly, for example).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A hero can attempt any of these social interactions by making the listed skill check:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Witty Banter: The hero engages one or more guests in conversation on any number of topics. Have the player make a DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A failure results in the hero making an off-putting or ill-mannered remark.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Attentive Listener: Careful observation and active listening help the hero pick up on important details and appear sympathetic and understanding. Have the player make a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. A failure results in the hero losing focus and completely misunderstanding the speaker’s point.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Innuendo: The hero engages in a more subtle type of conversation, one in which what is left unsaid is most important. Have the player make a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. A failure means that the hero misinterpreted another guest’s meaning or accidentally implied something embarrassing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Blend In: The hero tries to blend in to the crowd to avoid drawing attention. Have the player make a DC 21 Dexterity (Stealth) check. A failure means that other guests notice the hero’s shyness, perhaps mistaking it for aloofness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: The result of this reception sets the tone for the remainder of the social encounters on the* Gem of Alderaan.* If the heroes made a good impression, they will find it substantially easier to gain the attention and approval of major guests (and, by extension, Lady Aldrete).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NONCOMBAT ENCOUNTERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here are a few suggestions for handling this section of the adventure and its focus on social, nonviolent encounters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assigning Skill Checks: Instead of telling the players their options right away, let them describe what they want to do in real-world terms. Use their descriptions to decide which option is closest to their intent, calling for the appropriate skill checks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If your players have trouble coming up with an approach to these sorts of encounters, particularly at the beginning, be ready to list each option along with its associated skill check, but don’t tell the players the specific DCs right away. As the adventure progresses, though, you should find the players adapting to these encounters, perhaps even suggesting the use of skills that aren’t listed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alternative Skills: Each noncombat encounter lists several skills that can be used to gain the desired outcome, but this list is not necessarily exhaustive or exclusive. If a player suggests another relevant skill that might be useful in the situation and provides a reasonable explanation of how to apply it, give that player the benefit of the doubt and let him make the attempt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ALL ABOARD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the reception draws to a close, Lady Aldrete appears to welcome the guests and invite everyone on board the Gem of Alderaan. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After a short introduction by the emcee, Lady Aldrete walks out on stage wearing a revealing, low-cut dress that you wouldn’t expect to see on a noblewoman. She makes her way to the lectern, leaning against it with one hand while holding a snifter of Alderaanian brandy in the other.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Okay, everyone,” she says, slightly slurring her words, “I know a lot of you. And a lot of you are here because you know my grandpa. And a few are here for the free drinks.” She giggles loudly, prompting some forced laughter from the assembled guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Either way, thanks for coming to our launch, and you’ll be the first to see all the great stuff Grandpa put in. And there are bars in every repulsorcar and a nightclub on the back of the train—those were my ideas! And I got bouncers and everything to keep the worst riffraff outta my club—and to keep the best riffraff in!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>She winks, raises her glass, and takes a drink of brandy before wandering away from the lectern, drawing applause from the fawning masses. While the guests file onto the massive repulsortrain, Lady Aldrete is hurried on board by her staff, bypassing everyone else in line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once on board, give the heroes a little time to explore. The repulsortrain is much shorter than it would be during regular service because this is an invitation-only maiden voyage, only a few hours long. From front to back, the Gem of Alderaan includes:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A control car, where the crew control the operation of the repulsortrain. For safety reasons, this area is sealed off from passengers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A lounge car, featuring all-around windows that provide a breathtaking panoramic view. The lounge is broken down into semiprivate areas for small gatherings, and available amenities include an extensive library, a fine selection of spirits, and even atmospheric bubbles for guests to adjust the environment to match their comforts (and to keep t’bac and spice odors away from others).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A dining car, seating dozens in a split-level dining area that includes smaller, two-person tables for couples, four- to sixperson tables for small groups, and a single large banquet table for large gatherings. Underneath the upper level are the kitchens, fully automated with state-of-the-art luxury autochefs and taking up far less room than such a stunning gourmet kitchen would normally require. The top level also includes a bar and another Mon Calamari water sculpture, this fountain somewhat smaller and less ornate than the one at the reception.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A casino car that includes four sabacc tables, three Savareen whist dealers, two jubilee wheel tables, and two large banks of credit game machines on the trailing balcony. In addition, the casino has a stage for various entertainment, two bars (one on each level), and a heavily armored, secure cashier’s area dominating one side of the car.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A car dedicated to Lady Aldrete’s personal nightclub, Decadence. It is kept dark except for pulsing strobe lights and dim table lamps, and the dance floor noticeably vibrates from the pounding, relentless beat of high-tempo music. The lower level has a bar, several booths, the dance floor, a main stage, and two smaller dance stages with a floor-to-ceiling bronzium pole. The upper level has small tables, booths, a bar, a single sabacc table, and a small manager’s suite that overlooks the dance floor. Unlike the other cars, this one has a bouncer at the entrance who turns away anyone not deemed important (or attractive) enough to come inside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TRAVELING IN STYLE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Give the heroes some time to explore the train as a whole before starting the different social encounters outlined below. They can be undertaken in any order. The players can announce what sorts of things they want to look for, or you can reveal each encounter when the heroes are in a position to observe them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These encounters are meant to be approached one at a time by the entire group. However, the heroes can split up, each handling a different encounter that is particularly suited to their individual strengths. Heroes can join another encounter already in progress unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: To gain the notice of Lady Aldrete, the heroes must fulfill the following criteria at the end of all encounters in Traveling in Style:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Group attitude of the guests must be helpful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At least one major guest must be helpful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The number of major guests who are helpful or friendly must be greater than the number of major guests who are indifferent or unfriendly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>No major guests can be hostile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: When the heroes have drawn sufficient positive attention from the other guests, you can move on to the Private Invitation section. However unless the players are growing antsy from the lack of combat encounters, there is no reason that you can’t have the heroes participate in all of the social encounters below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A FRIENDLY GAME OF SABACC</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the casino, a lively game of sabacc has started between several attendees, including three major guests. Each round of gambling— representing a series of several hands of sabacc—requires a stake of 2,000 credits and a DC 21 Intelligence (sabacc deck) or a DC 21 Charisma (sabacc deck) check. If failed by less than 5, the character keeps their stake, if failed by less than 10, the character gives up half their stake, if failed by 10 or more, they give their entire stake to the competing character.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A player with less than 2,000 credits can still play however they make the check with disadvantage as it is easier for other characters to push them out of the game with high bets and on a failed check they automatically give their entire stake to the competing character.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A player may come up with ways to affect their chances at winning. If they attempt to bluff, read body language or something else that would distract their opponents or give them an edge, consider giving them advantage for their next roll. However if they attempt to cheat, a failed check results in their expulsion from the game and the group attitude of the Gala attendants drops by one level (for example, from indifferent to unfriendly).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The players at the table are listed below with their bankroll.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ardia Terrsyn, actress (major guest) — 5,000 credits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dien Subb, SoroSuub executive (major guest) — 6,000 credits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Zalar Rishek, scion of the House of Rishek (major guest) — 4,000 credits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tavid Ahkoeri — 2,000 credits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anjeru Valett — 2,000 credits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dyni Endarsin — 2,000 credits</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: If the heroes defeat all the minor guests (Tavid Ahkoeri, Anjeru Valett, and Dyni Endarsin), they impress the other attendees, improving the group attitude of the guests by one step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat a major guest, they can either improve the attitude of that major guest by one step or improve the group attitude of the Gala attendants by one step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless of how well the heroes perform during this encounter, the group attitude of the Gala attendants cannot have a net improvement of more than one step. For example, if the heroes were caught cheating (one step worse) but they beat three major guests (each worth one step of improvement), the net effect is one step of improvement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: Any credits won during these games are allowed to be kept. Additionally the heroes are not expected to defeat all opponents nor is it required.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARMCHAIRS AND HOLOCHESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A warm and cozy spot in the lounge is an ideal place for a stimulating intellectual discussion with the galaxy’s elite. Morrax Nabin, Imperial governor (major guest), sits by the holochess board, hoping someone will join him for a casual game. Until then, he is enjoying some Alderaanian brandy with Dien Suub, SoroSuub executive (major guest); Cednah Faenel, Alderaanian noblewoman (major guest); and several others— Professor Wachs Tauph, Dr. Stae-Fahnti Koelbayr, and Mahg-Raet Duumont—as they discuss financial markets, history, politics, and any other topic that arises.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: All heroes present must participate in the conversation, or at least try to blend in. Participation is optional for a hero playing holochess. During each round of discussion the guests will bring up certain topics prompting an ability check from the players to see if they can keep up with the conversation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medicine: Make a DC 18 Intelligence (Medicine) check. If successful, you recount recent developments in biotech, cybernetics, surgical techniques, pharmaceuticals, or epidemiology.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Politics: Make a DC 19 Intelligence (Lore) check. If successful, you make several relevant points on recent political debates and controversies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Technology: Make a DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check. If successful, you discuss the implications of recent breakthroughs in engineering, manufacturing, and architecture.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Trade: Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Piloting) check. If successful, you use knowledge of hyperlanes and astrogational challenges to make several insightful comments about issues in interstellar trade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ummm . . . What He Said: Make a DC 22 Charisma (Deception) check. If successful, you avoid drawing attention to your breathtaking lack of knowledge about academia, skillfully redirecting questions toward another in the conversation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The objective is for the heroes to contribute something meaningful to the conversation as many times as possible out of 8 rounds of conversation. If the heroes make three or more embarrassing, uneducated, or amateurish remarks (signified by a failed ability check) in total, they prompt chuckles and condescending remarks from the other guests (“Well, I suppose someone has to attend those universities on the Outer Rim”), effectively ending this challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: Only one hero can play against Governor Nabin in a game of holochess. The objective is to be successful at least four times with various strategies, outlined below, resulting in the hero checkmating the governor. However, if the hero hasn’t done so after six attempts, the governor’s superior experience in the game allows him to defeat the hero by attrition after a protracted struggle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the players make DC 25 Intelligence (dejarik set) check, If the player is also involved in conversation, resolve that after each round of holochess. If you wish to explain some of the moves in greater detail, use the sample explanations below for inspiration for either failure or success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lightning Round. The player plans out several contingencies while examining Nabin's moves, as he finishes his contemplation and move, the player swiftly responds, intimidating the governor somewhat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Relentless Assault. The player executes a flawless classical set-piece attack, keeping the governor on the retreat and backfoot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Misdirect and Reveal. The player draws the governor's attention to an intricate feint, but their moves open up a completely unexpected avenue of attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Spoiler Instead of the player siezing the offensive, they anticipate the governor's next move, playing solely to spoil his attacks and frustrate him into making a mistake that leaves him vulnerable elsewhere;.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: Successful participation in the conversation improves either group attitude, Dien Suub’s attitude, or Cednah Faenel’s attitude by one step. If the heroes do so without a single failure, all three improve by one step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Defeating Governor Nabin improves either guest attitude or the governor’s attitude by one step. A perfect game (no failures) improves both by one step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Group attitude cannot improve by more than one step during a single encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FINE TASTES</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A multicourse dinner is served that evening in the dining car, and the heroes—as representatives of Senator Organa—are asked to sit at the banquet table. The meal is exquisite:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It starts with a cocktail hour with Coruscant blush wine, Corellian spiced ale, and Duros ale (or Reythan berry juice and Barnaban mistwater for those who prefer something nonalcoholic), with stuffed Plavonian starfish and raw rockfish twists for hors d’oeuvres.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For soup, there is a choice between hillindor fowl and Ukian torbull tail, with Neonan red cheese and Alderaanian flatbread on the side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The salad is cut from fresh greens from Ithor, with a Coruscant red wine vinaigrette.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For a palate cleanser, Ithorian starfruit blended in a light creme liqueur.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the main course, there is a choice of roast Alderaanian gorak served in malla petals or broiled Nerf tenderloin, with a side of Ghoba rice pilaf and Verdian vine beans. It is served with a glass of Corellian merlot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, for dessert, there is a choice of a Forrolow berry parfait, Corellian air cake, or Barnaban mist-pudding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each course is delivered by four red-uniformed BD-3000 droids— luxury droids with a statuesque and sleek feminine sculpt, seen as a status symbol among the richest of the social elite.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most guests visit the dining car at some point, but meal service is staggered to accommodate all aboard. When the heroes dine, some other guests at the main table include Morrax Nabin, Imperial governor (major guest); Lynaa, famed fashion designer (major guest); Cednah Faenel, Alderaanian noblewoman (major guest); Capt. Z’paul Diin, Dr. Hakaen Bousch, and Ruf-Asti-Viarffli.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: The challenge for the heroes is to make civilized conversation while enjoying the finest foods from across the galaxy—and without looking like they just fell off a spice freighter from Tatooine. To make a good impression, the heroes need to participate meaningfully in the conversation as many times as possible, up to a maximum of six.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Three unsuccessful attempts to participate—whether unsophisticated (“Yummy!”) or uninformed (“Of course nerf come from Bespin!”)—result in the heroes’ opinions not being taken seriously for the remainder of the meal, effectively ending the challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Light Conversation: Make a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they engage their dining partners in casual conversation unrelated to the meal but charming nonetheless. Empty banter grows tiresome, however, so add +3 to the DC for each previous attempt by any of the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oenology: Make a DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing players to add their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in brewer's kits. On a success, they make insightful observations about the wine, remarking on its vintage and character. A failure makes this option unavailable to them for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Secret Ingredients: Make a DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing players to add their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in chef's kits or DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) check On a success, their experience with foods—improvised or otherwise—on countless worlds allows them to identify and comment on some of the herbs, spices, and other ingredients in a given dish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exotic Dishes: Make a DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing players to add their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in chef's kits. On a success, they recall something about the planet and culture of origin for a particular dish, perhaps commenting on the chef’s reinterpretation of the traditional version.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>No, Seriously, I’m a Chef: Make a DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, they make up some detail about a dish that sounds plausible, at least for the duration of the meal. Repeated fabrications eventually push the boundaries of believability, so add +2 to the DC for each previous attempt by any of the heroes. On a failure, the other guests become incredulous at their “facts,” making this option unavailable to any hero for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FoodNet Addict: Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, all that time spent browsing the HoloNet pays off, and they recall reading or watching something about a given dish. A failure makes this option unavailable to them for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Taking a Peek: If a player is force sensitive, have them make a DC 20 universal force-casting check. On a success, they glimpse some detail about a dish’s origin, perhaps a brief vision about how it was prepared. On a failure, they cannot do this rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: If the heroes make fewer than three blunders during their conversation over dinner, improve the group attitude of the guests and the individual attitude of all major guests by one step. If the heroes failed to do so but still had at least one success for each hero before accumulating three failures, the heroes can improve either group attitude or the attitude of a single major guest by one step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTANGLEMENTS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Club Decadence: Nothing could better embody the excess, debauchery, and hedonism that gave Lady Aldrete her fame. Cloaked in darkness and illuminated only by multicolored strobe lights, holoprojectors, and table lamps, the entire car pulses with a pounding beat. The younger guests (and the young at heart) come here to dance, carouse, and flirt—not necessarily in that order. Some notable guests present when the heroes arrive include Ardia Terrsyn, actress (major guest); Lynaa, famed fashion designer (major guest); Zalar Rishek, scion of the House of Rishek (major guest); Khyyynett, Brial Sullor, and Fia Nazhena.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The bouncer at the door refuses entry to the heroes (“You’re not on the list”) unless the guests have a group attitude of friendly or better, or at least one major guest has an attitude of friendly or better. However, the bouncer can be bribed (200 credits) with a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Offering ten times this amount grants advantage on this check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: The heroes need to make a memorable impression on these guests, being eye-catching, entertaining, and captivating even as they try not to look like they’re trying too hard. The heroes want to accumulate as many successes as possible, to a maximum of six. A little humiliation goes a long way, though: If the heroes accumulate a total of three failed activities over the encounter, their efforts begin to draw ridicule and scorn, effectively ending the challenge. (Heroes who want to participate in the auxiliary challenge, below, cannot participate in the primary challenge.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Served! Make a DC 16 Charisma (Performance) check. If successful, your dance moves impress the crowd, outshining the competition. On a failure, you are outperformed by a rival, effectively closing off this approach. Because you need to show off new moves, add +2 to the DC for each previous attempt. Heroes can use the Help action to grant advantage on this check if they are also proficient in Performance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pickup Artist: Make a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If successful, you attract the attention of a romantic prospect, making you the center of attention. On a failure, you are shot down in a particularly visible way, preventing further attempts. It’s difficult to attract multiple prospects in rapid succession, so add +2 to the DC for each previous attempt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Club Mix: You hit the audio booth and take a turn at mixing some tunes. Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check or DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. If successful, you mix a creative mash-up of different songs, drawing rousing approval from the crowd. On a failure, your attempt is halting, uneven, and embarrassing, preventing any future attempts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Break It Up! A scuffle breaks out near you between Zalar Rishek (major guest) and Khyyynett, with their respective entourages looking on. Make a DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If successful, you convince the two calm down before the situation escalates. If you fail, the scuffle escalates into a brawl before the players eyes. Heroes can use the Help action to grant advantage on this check if they are also proficient in Persuasion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: Though lumguzzling is mostly associated with Corellian spacers’ dives, the drinking contest has gained popularity (and notoriety) on the club scene and among idle rich who are “slumming.” In this challenge, one or more heroes go head to head with a rowdy bunch of drinkers, among them Lynaa (who, despite being twice the age of most in attendance, is quite gifted at the game). Whoever remains standing is the winner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the players make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw when they first take a drink, on a successful save the player suffers no ill effects and continue to the next round. On a failed save the player is still standing but becomes intoxicated, gaining the poisoned condition. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they fall unconscious and fail the challenge. The DC of the Consitution save increases by 1 after every round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If multiple heroes participate and last 4 rounds, all receive full credit for beating the opposition, but the players can continue the contest for additional rounds for the sake of bragging rights.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though lum is a strong alcoholic beverage, its chemical structure breaks down exponentially faster as its concentration increases in an individual’s bloodstream, making it impossible to overdose on the drink. Because of this, any ill effects caused by lumguzzling is automatically removed if the hero rests for 10 minutes after the end of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: If the heroes complete the primary challenge, they improve either group attitude or Ardia Terrsyn’s attitude by one step. If they broke up a fight, they also improve Zalar Rishek’s attitude by one step. If at least one hero completes the auxiliary challenge, he or she improves either group attitude or Lynaa’s attitude by one step. Group attitude cannot improve by more than one step in a single encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PRIVATE INVITATION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes satisfy the criteria for completing Traveling in Style, they are approached by Notru’denn, an old male Twi’lek who works as Lady Aldrete’s personal assistant. He says that Lady Aldrete is interested in meeting the heroes, and he invites them to her office on the top floor of the nightclub. Once there, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Aldrete’s office, featuring a desk, couch, and a small end table, seems remarkably plain for someone of her station. Her office has one other door, and a large window—actually a one-way mirror overlooking the dance floor—dominates the wall behind the desk.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Notru’denn invites you to have a seat on the couch. Once the office door closes, he leans against the desk and folds his arms. “Before we go any further, I’d like to know who you really are and why you’ve gone to such lengths to get Lady Aldrete’s attention.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Give the heroes a chance to explain the situation, but Notru’denn already knows that they are wanted by the Empire and working for Senator Organa. If they don’t come clean, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Let me rephrase that. My sources indicate that your identification and records did not exist yesterday morning. I had our slicers compare our personnel ‘backup’ of the database to be sure. It took me a bit to make the connection, but we know that Senator Organa is hiding fugitives from the Empire, and despite cosmetic differences in appearance, you match their descriptions quite well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“So,” he smiles, “let’s return to my earlier question. Why do you want to meet Lady Aldrete so badly? What do you need from her?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Notru’denn continues questioning the heroes until he is convinced that he has most of the facts. If the heroes claim to need anything other than the Deep Core clearance codes, Notru’denn shoots down the claim by pointing out a much easier way of getting it. Use the following phrases as a guideline for his responses:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Oh, you could find that in one afternoon on Nar Shaddaa.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Wouldn’t the Bothan SpyNet be able to provide that information with a lot less fuss?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I’m sure an Imperial Senator—even one who seems not to like the Empire—could pull strings to make that happen without asking for our help.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes mention the Deep Core clearance codes, Notru’denn realizes that they are serious. His whole tone changes, becoming less bemused and more concerned. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“You’ve leveled with me, so I’ll do the same. Lady Aldrete is not who she seems to be. All this,” he gestures, indicating the nightclub, the repulsortrain, and even her life in general, “is just an act.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Lady Aldrete controls an information network that stretches from Alderaan to Empress Teta. Her smugglers double as observers and spies, particularly in the Deep Core. Even the Bothan SpyNet can’t match her infiltration of that region. One effect of the Emperor’s pro-Human policies is that it’s much easier to notice when Bothan spies show up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Lady Aldrete maintains the image of a spoiled heiress because it keeps the Empire away. The gossip media constantly reports on where she’s clubbing, who she’s dating, and where she’s vacationing, so why assign an Imperial Intelligence agent to do the same?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Now, since it seems we have a common enemy in the Empire, I’m sure Lady Aldrete will be open to providing what you need.” He keys a button on the desk, opening a comm channel. “Milady, everything checks out. Join us in your office when you’re able.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Very good, I’ll be there shortly,” she replies, with a businesslike tone to her voice that seems out of place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Notru’denn offers the heroes a drink while they wait. Allow some casual conversation, but if the PCs press for more details, he suggests that they wait for Lady Aldrete so that she can speak for herself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note: This should be considered a level up milestone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: THE UNINVITED.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After their heroes have had some time for some casual conversation with Notru’denn and any necessary recuperation, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The repulsortrain suddenly shakes, and a distant rumbling can be heard over the din of the music in the club. A moment of silence, then another deep rumbling, this one much closer. Something is terribly wrong.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Notru’denn turns to the terminal built into the desk. “We’ve been boarded, multiple points of entry. There’s a transport flying ahead of the control car, it looks—”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He is interrupted by a voice over the intercom. The speaker hisses with a deep Trandoshan accent: “Organa! We know you’re aboard—surrender and the rest of the passengers can go free.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The voice cuts off suddenly, replaced by static. Notru’denn checks one control panel, then another, then another. “All internal communications and data connections are dead. And if our boarder thinks Senator Organa is on board, he’ll probably be very, very angry when he can’t find him.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the players make a Intelligence (Technology) check to see how much they know about their situation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15 The couplers that join each repulsorcar to the next include a bundle of communications and data connections. If all external feeds are out, these probably have been cut manually.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>20 Repulsortrains normally have emergency brakes that activate automatically if the connection to another car is lost. Since the Gem of Alderaan isn’t slowing, the boarders must be overriding the safety mechanism from the control car.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>25 The high-energy ionization from train’s repulsor rail connection makes normal communication very difficult, so repulsortrains normally feed all incoming and outgoing calls through a subspace radio. With internal communications cut and the control car in the hands of the boarders, it might be impossible to call for help.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Notru’denn doesn’t have much equipment available for the heroes, but he gives them some standard rarity blasters or vibroweapons hidden in the room. It's up to you what weapons you wish to hand out but consider how they would be hidden inside an office room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Here, take these. I saw multiple entry points before the sensors cut out, so they’ll be here any moment. Go see what you can do to help. If that thug can’t find Senator Organa, he might start hurting other passengers, or he might take Lady Aldrete hostage instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I’ll stay here and see if I can rig something to send a distress signal. Go, hurry!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BOARDED!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes begin in Lady Aldrete’s office, and the Trandoshan mercenaries and berserkers begin in the intercar area (marked “Boarding Party”). At least two dozen guests are in the club, cowering under tables or behind bars.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The doors connecting to the casino car fly open to reveal four Trandoshans, probably mercenaries. Two wield carbines, and the other two have a pair of wicked vibroblades.

From the small windows in the cashier’s area, they focus their attacks on the war droid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The stormtroopers try to stay adjacent to the governor, using Harm’s Way to protect him from attacks.

(The stormtroopers believe that the heroes are agents of the Empire, since they are listed on the staff of a member of the Imperial Senate and excuse any force powers they see as the player being a member of the Inquisitorius.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Governor Nabin, however, is shaken by the attack, and his initial reaction is to insist that his bodyguards stay by his side. The heroes can attempt to talk him into letting the stormtroopers fight the mercenaries, but it requires carefully phrased arguments.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the player make a DC 21 Charisma (Persuasion) check, on a success the governor releases the stormtroopers to the temporary command of the heroes. They follow any orders given by the heroes that don’t obviously conflict with their duty to the Empire (such as intentionally harming the governor or other guests). On a failed save he is unwilling to release the stormtroopers and he and his stormtroopers retreat to the Decadence nightclub while leaving some equipment behind. The equipment consists of 4 stun grenades, 4 blaster rifles (or 4 blaster pistols) and an improved medpac.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Development: Because the heroes are allegedly representatives of an Imperial senator, the stormtroopers make every effort to protect and aid the heroes unless the governor specifically orders them to do otherwise. If the stormtroopers survive this encounter, they continue to aid the heroes in subsequent encounters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The war droid's mounted E-Web weapons are able to be removed with some effort however their potency has been reduced from battle damage and function only as a rotary cannon weapon. They come with a power generator for each but no tripod meaning any player without 19 strength cannot effectively use them in combat. The ion rifles are also salvageable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BREAKOUT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>By the time the heroes reach the next car, the mercenaries have heard the sounds of battle, and they know that trouble is coming.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The mercenaries are not surprised, and they are ready to attack as soon as the heroes open the door. Two highly trained veterans—an elite mercenary (A) and a marauder (B)—stand nearby to block movement on the upper level. In the rear, the unit’s sergeant (S) stays behind cover on one side while another boarding party (BP) guards the other. In the lower dining area, about two dozen hostages sit on the floor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When first looking through the window on the train car door, the heroes cannot see the two veterans (A and B), so do not place them until the door opens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A peek through the window shows that the mercenaries are fortified and ready to fight. You see another unit of mercenaries guarding the far left wall, and there is a single heavily armed Trandoshan behind a table on the opposite side. Perhaps twenty hostages sit on the ground in the lower dining area, directly between the mercenaries.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes open the door, reveal the veterans (A and B) and read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You couldn’t see them before, but there are two more mercenaries— one with a carbine, one with a vibro-ax—guarding the flanks.

If any passengers survive, they tell the heroes that she was taken toward the front of the train by the mercenary commander. Shortly after the end of the encounter, Notru’denn arrives and tells the heroes that he believes he got a distress call through to a friendly starship. He’s not sure how long it might take for the ship to intercept the repulsortrain. As long as any passengers survive, one of them is Dr. Hakaen Bousch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dr. Hakaen Bousch is a trained medical professional and can give the players the benefit of a short rest if they require one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DEATH FROM ABOVE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before the heroes move beyond the dining car, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You hear a loud whining overhead—the scream of ship engines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let the players make a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, read or paraphrase the following on a successful check:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The sound is coming from a pair of starfighters flying very close by, no more than a few dozen meters away.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the Perception check was successful, a character proficient in the Technology or Piloting skills, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You recognize the engine noise—CloakShape fighters. They were old even at the start of the Clone Wars, and they definitely are not used by any local security forces on Alderaan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the heroes identified the source of the noise, the fighters continue to attack. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A moment later, you hear the thunder of laser cannons firing. The repulsortrain lurches violently as the overhead lights flicker out, and from the next car, you hear the sounds of shattering glass, twisting metal, and a continuous, deafening roar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A quick glance toward the next repulsorcar (the lounge car) shows the extent of the damage: The car has been all but destroyed, its roof and windows completely blown away. At the far end of the car, staying low and against the wall to avoid the winds, a heavily armored team of mercenaries waits, weapons aimed at the door of the dining car.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any stormtroopers or passengers are present, they tell the heroes that the damage to the lounge car puts the trailing repulsorcars in jeopardy. If the lounge car were to break apart, the debris, high winds, and sudden loss of power probably would cause the rear half of the train to derail and plunge to the ground over 330 feet below. To prevent that from happening, the heroes must manually uncouple the dining car from the lounge car, triggering each repulsorcar’s internal emergency brakes. If no stormtroopers or passengers are present, call for a DC 18 Intelligence Technology check to see if the heroes can reach this conclusion independently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the stormtroopers are still alive, they cannot leave the governor behind, so they must remain on the trailing repulsorcars to protect the civilians there in case any mercenaries are hiding in the rear half of the train. The stormtroopers provide whatever aid they can (such as shooting at the mercenaries at the far end of the lounge car) until the heroes uncouple the dining car.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes begin at the rear entrance, and there is an elite mercenary team at the far end of the car (marked EM). The red squares indicate conduit hazards (see below)—do not mark these on the map until they detonate or the players detect them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes uncouple the dining car, they must deal with two CloakShape fighters, but the ships are too distant to appear on the map.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The lounge car is devastated—its carpeting, seating, walls, and windows have been completely blown away. Fires rage on the left and right side of the car, and the twisted metal flooring is ripped open in places. A heavily armored mercenary team waits against the far wall, kneeling and sheltered from the high winds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Allow the players to make a DC 23 Wisdom (Perception) check, read or paraphrase the following on a successful check:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some of the holes in the metal flooring have exposed power conduits. The power conduits, if live, are potentially very dangerous, perhaps even explosive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REALEASING THE COUPLERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The devastated lounge car is connected to the dining car at six coupling points. Each groans and twists, moments away from failing and releasing a massive ionic discharge from the unirail overhead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the challenges of this encounter is to safely uncouple the trailing cars from the severely damaged lounge car, protecting the civilians onboard from the potential of a catastrophic failure. Uncoupling the training cars from the lounge car requires a little finesse or a lot of brute strength, but failing to do so correctly can cause a massive ion discharge from the repulsor rail. The car is coupled at six separate attachment points, and the heroes can make only a single attempt on each coupler. There are several different ways to approach each one, and each attempt requires an action:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coupler 1: A DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to contort your body to squeeze underneath a twisted floor plate, tripping the emergency release on a coupler concealed within.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coupler 2: A DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to brave the high winds to reach a coupler’s emergency release on the outside of the repulsorcar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coupler 3: A DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check to use your knowledge of similar devices, examine an unlabeled coupler to determine which release lever is the correct one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Coupler 4 and 5: A DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check to cut through fused joints to release the locking mechanisms using their toolkit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any Coupler: A DC 15 Strength check to brute force and apply smart leverage to pry apart twisted metal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any Coupler: Using the force to pry apart the broken twisted, broken metal and to decouple the coupler.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Couplers #4, #5, and #6 can be separated from the intercar area, but couplers #1, #2, and #3 can be released only from inside the lounge car (exposing the heroes to fire from the elite mercenary team).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes make no attempt at all for 1 round, the repulsorcar groans under the stress as more support members buckle and break; one coupler, determined randomly, automatically fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once a total of four are safely uncoupled, the trailing repulsorcars separate without incident and the passengers are safe. If all six are attempted without achieving four successes, the uncoupling releases a massive ionic discharge. Every character within 20 feet of the rear of the repulsor car must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10) ion damage for every coupler that was not released correctly, up to maximum of 66 (12d10) ion damage. On a successful save, the target takes half damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The passengers in the trailing cars survive a faulty separation, but many are injured by the turbulence and the secondary effects of the ionic discharge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TRANDOSHAN ELITE MERCENARY (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This team of heavily armored Trandoshan mercenaries has weapons drawn and ready.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TRANDOSHAN ELITE MERCENARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid, any dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 17 (natural armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 127 (17d8 + 51)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15 (+2) 18 (+4) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 16 (+3) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +5, Wis +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +7, Intimidation +5, Perception +6, Persuasion +5, Stealth +6, Survival +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic, Dosh</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (2,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Infrared Vision.

If a character enters one of the red-bordered squares on the map, have the character make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 21 (4d10) fire damage and ignites. A successful save causes the target to take half damage and does not ignite. An ignited creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of it's turn unless it or another creature uses an action to douse the flames.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Conduit hazards can potentially cause other conduits to explode, setting off a chain reaction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Detection: A player can take the Search action to discover the closest hidden conduit hazard within line of sight with a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disarming: A conduit can be disarmed by using an action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check. If this check is failed by 5 or more the conduit explodes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Detonating: Conduit hazards can be intentionally detonated by dealing damage to them. They have an AC of 17 and if they take 10 damage from any source, they explode.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CLOAKSHAPE FIGHTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This archaic starfighter has broad, wide wings and a bulbous canopy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Due to the speed of the repulsortrain, the CloakShape fighters can attack only by making an attack run. Have a character targeted by the CloakShape Fighter make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw with a failed save dealing 33 (6d10) energy damage</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Particularly creative (or foolhardy) heroes might try to capture one of the fighters. A character can jump onto the canopy of a CloakShape fighter as it flies by if they can somehow jump 60 feet up into the air. It requires a DC 27 Dexterity (Acrobactics) check in order to not fail and tumble 300 feet to the ground as they lose their footing from the pilot attempting to shake off the character.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the player successfully mounts the CloakShape fighter, they can use an object interaction to pop the emergency release handle on the cockpit and expose the pilot to danger. If the pilot is attacked he ejects out of danger leaving the fighter for the player to control.

Areas of the floor with visibly missing plating can also be traversed, but many such squares are also conduit hazards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strong Winds: The sheer force of the wind in this area has disadvantage on their attacks as they cant steady their aim enough. If an object is thrown and the attack roll is a 1, the thrown object is pulled off the side of the train from the wind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The encounter ends when the heroes make it through the doors at the front of the car, leading to the repulsortrain’s control car, or when all opponents are eliminated.

You are on a catwalk that encircles the car's interior, suspended above the lower engine compartment. More machinery and large tanks dominate the middle of the room, from the floor up to the ceiling.

The trandoshan throws a dioxus grenade, choosing a point within 45 ft., exploding in a 15 feet sphere. The fog lasts 1 round and the area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the poison's area or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

The trandoshan can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hostage: Lady Aldrete is bound, helpless, and unable to speak, and the commander can use her as a shield. As a free action, he can hold her in front of him in a way that grants three quarters cover against attackers he is aware of. Any attack that misses the commander by an amount less than or equal to the cover bonus instead strikes Lady Aldrete. As a free action, the commander can drop her into any adjacent square (but not over the guardrail, such on the catwalk).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TRANDOSHAN MERCENARY COMMANDER TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The mercenary commander uses Commando extensively, moving as necessary to keep cover between him and the heroes. However, he does not venture more than 30 feet from the top hatch, and he will not come within 20 feet of the fuel line until after it detonates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 5 or 6 (earlier if he is sufficiently threatened) he grabs Lady Aldrete and carries her up to the extraction area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If by round 10 the heroes have not killed him or saved Lady Aldrete, he boards the ship and the boarding ramp closes as it leaves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FUEL LINES</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A thick hose overhead suddenly bursts, spraying fuel into the air before being ignited by a spark. A massive explosion erupts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The mercenary commander has rigged the fuel line to detonate if any character moves into a catwalk square beneath it. If the line detonates, have all characters within 20 feet make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw with a failed save dealing 55 (10d10) fire damage. A successful save only deals half damage. Characters adjacent to the doors or on the lower level have three quarters cover for this save.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fuel line can also be detonated which the mercenary commander does if none of the characters have triggered a detonation by his second turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Disarming: A character can disarm this hazard from the lower engine compartment by making a DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check as an action. If successful, fuel is shunted out of the main line, preventing an explosion. If the check fails by 5 or more, the fuel line detonates immediately</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whether the fuel line is disarmed or detonated, the engines run out of fuel 10 rounds later. The shunted fuel line cannot be reactivated while the engines are in operation, and all control systems have been disabled.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CITADEL CRUISER (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A transport flies just ahead of and above the control car, anchored to the repulsortrain by a heavy tow cable.

Sirona Okeefe appears as the boarding ramp descends, ready to use a grappling spike launcher to cast secondary lines to heroes in need. She does not detach from the Gem of Alderaan until all surviving heroes are on board. The Banshee will crash 2 rounds after the engines fail if it is attached to the repulsortrain by itself. Once everyone is on board, Okeefe heads to the cockpit (or to a quad laser turret, if another character has already taken over piloting duties) and tries to escape from the mercenaries’ citadel cruiser unless instructed otherwise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LADY ALDRETE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Aldrete is helpless and unable to defend herself. She has a total of 40 hitpoints. If reduced to 0 hitpoints, she begins to make death saving throws but automatically stablises if she would otherwise die.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A character can attempt to pull Lady Aldrete out of the mercenary commander's hands by making a contested Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Lady Aldrete is dropped on the roof, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Aldrete is helpless as she falls onto the roof of the control car.

If any of these attempts succeed, Lady Aldrete is no longer in danger of falling over the side (unless she is dropped again). If no character reaches her, she falls over the side in the following round on the same initiative count that she was dropped.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Extraction Area: Both tow cables are attached here, and they can be manually released from this end or released from the boarding ramp on their respective transports.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes wish to prevent the citadel cruiser from detaching, they can attack the crew member on the boarding ramp (AC 15, hit points 30).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strong Winds: The Strong Winds here are the same as the Death from Above encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAPS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unless the players are defeated or the repulsortrain crashes, Sirona Okeefe flies the Banshee back to Senator Organa’s private retreat, giving the heroes ample time to talk to Lady Aldrete about their predicament.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Incredibly grateful for the heroes’ bravery, Lady Aldrete happily agrees to help them in any way she can. Her “attention-seeking heiress” persona falls away to reveal her true self: intelligent, serious, and determined.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After discussing the situation in detail, she hands over the Deep Core security clearance, along with instructions on how to download the latest astrogational data for the journey to Prakith. Lady Aldrete also offers to provide the heroes with a set of false transponder codes for their ship and a pirated HoloNet transceiver that can send encrypted messages over the Empire’s instantaneous communication network. (Both of these can be delivered and installed by the next day.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, Lady Aldrete has additional information about Inquisitor Draco and Master Denia. According to her spies, Draco’s personal starship—a modified Sienar armored star courier, similar to Darth Maul’s Sith Infiltrator—landed on Prakith at the newly built Citadel Inquisitorius months ago and has remained there ever since. If the intercepted messages can be trusted, Draco has Master Denia captive in the citadel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Aldrete has no new information about the prototype Super Star Destroyer or Admiral Varth, but there is no indication that anyone else has taken over the Sarlacc Project. It is almost certain that Varth is still working closely with Inquisitor Draco.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With that, Lady Aldrete leaves the heroes, but she promises to stay in touch on the HoloNet transceiver to provide information as it becomes available.

In this adventure, the heroes take their hunt for Master Denia to Prakith, an Imperial military stronghold and home to the headquarters of the Emperor’s Jedi hunters. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will see how the Empire is quickly reshaping Prakith and will rediscover an ancient race whose support against the Empire can be gained—if only they can be made to understand the threat. Sword of the Empire is the penultimate chapter in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, and the heroes should advance to 19th level by the end of the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IS DAWN OF DEFIANCE?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dawn of Defiance is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the adventures in the Dawn of Defiance campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic SW5e experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The Dawn of Defiance campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Dawn of Defiance adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Warning! If you will be playing in a Dawn of Defiance campaign or in a campaign utilizing its adventures, read no further.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CAMPAIGN UPDATE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sword of the Empire takes place only a few days to a few weeks after the conclusion of the previous adventure, The Gem of Alderaan, but the heroes will have found the interval to be a productive one. While they realize that time is of the essence in the search for Master Denia, the resources of Lady Alya Aldrete make it possible for them to prepare for what lies ahead. This is an ideal time for heroes to resupply and possibly choose a different vessel suitable for the operation. Events will move quickly from here, so it is worth communicating to players that they should use this time wisely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Alya’s support to the heroes is genuine, but they should expect limits in what she’s able to provide. Much of her aid should be in the way of giving them access to the items they need rather than in providing the items as outright gifts. Heroes might have an easier time finding what they’ve been looking for thanks to her connections, but they’ll still have to pay for what they receive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you aren’t running Dawn of Defiance but would like to use this adventure in your own campaign, a character relevant to your own storyline can be substituted for Master Denia, with the final rescue sequence altered to permit whatever resolution best suits your campaign.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ADVENTURE SUMMARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On entering the fringes of the Prakith system, the heroes encounter Jekk Seejo, a somewhat erratic alien engineer on what will prove to be his last disastrous assignment for an Admiralty fed up with his shenanigans. Heroes rescuing Seejo may come to regret it initially, since the act results in mynocks infesting their ship, but the engineer’s friendship comes in handy when they visit Prakith, a place abuzz with Imperial activity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Only recently surveyed by the Empire, Prakith has a much longer history than its Imperial residents are aware of. Prakith was touched by the dark side centuries ago, when it became home to the tomb of Darth Andeddu. That fact is unknown in Imperial times, and the tomb is not discovered until the Legacy era, but its foul presence is enough to give this world of cracked and ruined surfaces a feeling of genuine dread and gloom. No doubt, this ambiance was part of what drew the Inquisitorius to locate its Citadel here. Also unknown to the Empire, Prakith has a native species—or, at least, one transplanted here long ago: the Stereb, a stoic, sturdy race of stoneworkers living in the planet’s many catacombs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More recently, the Mining Guild has sponsored a number of limited operations on Prakith, ramping them up as the Empire’s activities require ever more materials. The spaceport and military headquarters are in Prak City, atop a large plateau. Citadel Inquisitorius rises in a mountainous redoubt, more than a hundred kilometers to the west. Inquisitors are active in Prak City as well, putting Force-users in constant danger of discovery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Direct attempts to approach the Citadel are frustrated. The cover identities the heroes arrive under might provide some mobility in Prak City and the surrounding environs, but airspace is closed around the Inquisitors’ mountain redoubt, and even masquerading as Imperial officers is unlikely to foil the security efforts of a group whose main talent is sniffing out Force-users. Local inquiries with miners provide some information (and the chance to proceed along a variant track), but the most promising lead comes from the discovery of Herdr’tui, a member of the subterranean Stereb race who is stuck aboveground. His people’s existence here is unknown to the Empire, as is the extent of their sprawling underground network.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Herdr’tui directs the heroes toward a place they’ve heard nothing good about: the Drains, a collection of vertical lava tubes used as a garbage (and recalcitrant slave) disposal by the Empire. Nothing that falls down there lives for long, thanks to an omnivorous creature that must be slain or brought to heel before Herdr’tui can be returned to his people. The Stereb, heroes learn, see themselves literally as part of Prakith—as the planet’s antibodies, in a sense, keeping its arteries clear and maintaining it as best they can. They can be rallied to resist the Empire, but only if the heroes recognize this relationship and convince the Stereb that the Empire represents a literal cancer on the body of their world. The Sterebs’ best resource is information on a secret underground approach to the Citadel Inquisitorius. But this knowledge is not gained easily; the heroes first must gain the Sterebs’ trust.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After securing the information, the heroes have an opportunity to enter the Citadel from beneath, which is possible only because the Empire did not realize that those who constructed the ruins at its base still existed. A treacherous speeder bike flight across an underground ocean under a low ceiling infested with fear moss is required first, but the problems are only beginning. Characters must make a daring night raid into the Citadel, learning the location of Master Denia and fighting past Inquisitors on their home turf. Finally, the heroes confront the new and cybernetically improved Inquisitor Draco for a battle royale. An act of self-sacrifice by Master Denia forces Draco to abandon the Citadel, but at least the Empire now knows its subjects are ready and willing to fight for their freedom.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OPENING CRAWL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS : DAWN OF DEFIANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Episode XI: Sword of the Empire</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is a critical moment for the first few willing to stand against the Galactic Empire. Jedi Master Denia, one of the few survivors of Order 66, has fallen into the hands of Valin Draco and the Inquisitorius, a secret division of Imperial Jedi hunters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Setting out in search of Master Denia, a hardy group of heroes finds an ally in Lady Alya Aldrete. The resourceful Alderaanian provides the transit permits necessary for them to reach the Deep Core world of Prakith, where Denia is held captive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But Prakith is a more complicated puzzle than it seems. Home to a major new administrative headquarters for the Imperial fleet and the Citadel Inquisitorius, the world is well manned by the Emperor’s agents of darkness. But those might not be Prakith’s only residents . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 1: THE ARRIVAL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With Lady Alya’s forged credentials in hand, the heroes craft cover identities that will permit them to enter the general workforce when they reach Prakith. With a major naval installation, burgeoning mining operations, and the Citadel Inquisitorius, there is plenty of work on Prakith for contract laborers—at least, for those with enough friends in high places to find their way there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes arrive at the edge of the five-planet Prak system without incident. A quick scan reveals that their ship is the only one in the immediate area; traffic to and from Prakith is moderate, with a few construction ships heading in and mining vessels heading out. An automated message arrives from a hyperspace buoy nearby; this is not the standard Message to Spacers (METOSP), but an abrupt speech dripping with Imperial authority:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Attention! Attention! All work vessels immediately set course for Prakith orbit. Do not, repeat, do not deviate from a direct course to Prakith. Straying vessels will be intercepted and boarded by the Imperial Navy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“From orbit, utilize your own judgment as to approach vector to Prak City Control, but be advised of no-fly-zone 70 miles in radius from the Magraddor mountain range. Confer with orbital buoy on arrival for specific details.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes enter the quickest course to Prakith orbit. It takes three hours to get to Prakith orbit, and along the way only a single vessel, a Mining Guild freighter loaded with ore, passes the heroes, heading out to the hyperspace lanes. Prakith might soon become a busy center for the Empire, but it is clearly still a work in progress.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just before arriving in Prakith orbit, the heroes receive a weak distress call over subspace channels. It fades in and out but is strongest at the closest approach to the Inner Moon. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Um . . . hello? Hello? Um, looking for some help here? Anyone?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This is Jekk Seejo of the Good Feeling, just out of Prakith. We’re... well, we’re stuck. On the Inner Moon... Can anyone hear me? Systems are failing—power, life support... and then some of the more important stuff. Anyone out there?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Blast. I think we’re really in trouble this time...”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A simple DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check enables the heroes to track the signal to the Inner Moon, where the Good Feeling, a small kit-bashed “yacht” of dubious quality, sits at the center of a small crater. The ship’s gazetteer describes Prakith’s Inner Moon as having no atmosphere and gravity that is low but just enough to keep the Good Feeling from escaping in its current condition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But the buoy was specific: No course deviations. Heroes who decide to investigate without first contacting Prak City Control will receive a sharp radio warning, followed not long afterward by a detachment of TIE fighters if the heroes fail to change course, putting a crimp in their mission very early. However, if the heroes mention Jekk Seejo’s name to Prak City Control, permission is given:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Seejo? Again? I don’t believe that guy... Wait—yes, I do believe it. You’ve got a real live one there,” the controller says. “You’ve heard about disasters waiting to happen? Jekk Seejo is the one that already has. Well, you can tell him the Incom guys are done with him. Let him rot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Hold on a second—OK, I’ve just been informed he’s got some Subpro engineers aboard that they’d actually like back. He’s in luck, which is more than I can say for you. You are authorized to divert to Moon Prakith One to render aid. Over and out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Hey, Ervyn!” the voice says, fading. “Get this—Seejo wrecked another one...”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thus, whether the heroes actually help Seejo or not, they are obliged to make contact with him before resuming their course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GOOD FEELINGS AND BAD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Little more than a jalopy pieced together from various bits of old ships, the Good Feeling requires only one pilot but operates best with an army of mechanics. Right now, it is occupied by Jekk Seejo and four of his associates, all engineers working at the Imperial Testing Grounds on the Outer Moon. Two are Incom subcontractors and two work for Subpro, but the important thing is that they’re all engineers, not technicians. They know a good bit about designing starships, but less about flying them— and, quite obviously, not near enough about fixing them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes who dock with the Good Feeling learn this and more. Only Jekk Seejo, a chirpy, upbeat Duros, has much spaceflight experience, although the heroes realize pretty quickly that whatever is wrong with the ship is over his bald green head—particularly since he’s left his toolkit on Prakith. It takes a DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check to get the ship running again in short order.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes glance around while they are working on the ship or afterward, they spy one of the engineers working at a console. The console displays a ship design with which the heroes are utterly unfamiliar; it resembles a forced marriage of a large Z-95 Headhunter and an ARC-170. If the heroes ask Seejo about the ship, he begins chattering about a Deep Scout design that Subpro and Incom are jointly developing on the Outer Moon of Prakith—until one of the other engineers reminds the chatty Duros that secret does actually mean secret. “You’re hanging by a thread as it is, Seej.” Blushing—in his case, picking up a slightly bluer hue of green—Jekk coughs and chuckles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Receiving a message from his employers, Jekk makes his apologies and escorts the heroes to the airlock with their ship. “If you’re ever in Prak City, look me up,” he says. “I do a lot of thinking at the Mother Lode Cantina. Maybe we can talk hyperspace theory sometime—and, um, you can tell me again how you got that thingie back there to do what you got it to do.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>JEKK SEEJO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As an Incom employee, Jekk Seejo frequently let his enthusiasm for all things spaceworthy get out of hand. Fancying himself an amateur explorer and test pilot but without the training for either, Seejo often wheedled his coworkers into using his ship, an old clunker left over from the Clone Wars, as a guinea pig for their more outlandish concepts. By the time of the Empire, with COMPNOR beginning to purge aliens from the ranks of major defense firms, Seejo was reduced to the role of a subcontractor, finding work only when his friends in the engineering community brought him in. His happy manner frequently brings his fellow engineers along for the ride, even against their better judgments.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PRAK CITY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Read the following aloud as the heroes enter Prakith’s atmosphere and approach Prak City:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the Empire were looking for a more forbidding world to exploit, it could hardly have selected a better one than Prakith. A planet of tortured ridges, jagged canyons, and sandy gullies, Prakith could give Utapau and Tatooine a run for their money in the contest for the galaxy’s most desperately bleak world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From the air, you see the rugged Magraddor Range far to the west and, nestled within, the towering obsidian spire of the Citadel Inquisitorius. But you can’t reach it yet; a sentry wing of TIE fighters directs your ship far to the east, and Prak City.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Seated atop a plateau offering the largest unbroken patch of land on the planet, Prak City appears to be equal portions frontier town and military base—and the military base is winning. Large Imperial vessels sit docked at the city’s large eastern spaceport, towering over smaller supply and prospecting vessels that use the same pads. Their appearance and jobs might differ, but they all have the same purpose: bending this planet to the Emperor’s dark will.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish, give players a copy of the surface map detailing the locations of Prak City and the Citadel, since their descent will have given them that much information. But do not share the underground map nor intimate that such a map even exists.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exiting the spacecraft the Station Master, a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy requires the heroes to have their ship examined by a Port Licensed Contractor before they can depart again. He’s been on the station only a few weeks, and he doesn’t want his safety record spoiled by anybody who had to interact with Jekk Seejo. If only that annoying Duros would find another planet to infest!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contractors can be found in the Work Zone sector, the Station Master says, which is where a miserable lot like the heroes belong. It doesn’t take long for the heroes to realize that there is a serious culture clash between the burgeoning military population of the city and the workforce that’s building its launchpads and retaining walls and—further out in the canyons—digging up Prakith’s ores. Prak City might one day be limited exclusively to the military; this could be the heroes’ last chance to visit the world with even the limited freedoms they now have.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players cause too much trouble in Prak City for any reason, use four Imperial Sovereign Protectors from the 'Saving Seejo' encounter as a response force.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEAR THE INQUISITOR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The presence of Inquisitors in Prak City and the Citadel, constantly scanning for Force-users, puts Force-using characters at a severe handicap if they wish to avoid detection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a player uses a Force power within the confines of the overview map have the players make a DC 20 Wisdom or a DC 20 Charisma check, adding proficiency if they are proficient in the Deception skill. If they fail the check, the Inquisitors detects the Force-using hero and sends investigators to track him or her down. In Prak City and environs, this activates the “Curious Inquisitor” encounter; in the Citadel, it activates the “Citadel Security Team” encounter. This check is performed only performed once every 24 hours.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are two exceptions on the map, both relating to underground activities. Inquisitors might sense Force-users in the Stereb cave networks, but they won’t respond in a timely fashion because the Empire does not know the caverns exist. And as “Stairway to Hell” indicates, the gray fear moss that has accumulated near the Citadel (actually, in the cave ceiling above the Underground Sea nearby) mutes Inquisitor detection until the final 2 miles of the ascent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE MOTHER LODE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In contrast to the gleaming towers now going up for the military, the Work Zone of Prak City is quite a bit seamier. Ironically, this part of Prak City predates the Empire; the plateau made for a good location for mining prospectors to place their encampments. The miners are still there, but so are all the construction firms the Empire has brought in. The firms are actively taking down parts of the old city to put up a new one in its place—a city which, many of the residents in the Work Zone realize, they will not be welcome in. Their increasingly ghettoized community is an active part of its own destruction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Destruction of brain cells is the major leisure-time activity here, and inquiries will direct the heroes to a shrine devoted to the act: the Mother Lode Cantina. Managed by a female Bothan who gets left alone because she knows where all the skeletons are buried on Prakith, the Cantina is host to a wider range of individuals than would ever be allowed to congregate anywhere else on Prakith. There are construction workers and miners here, Human and alien both, with the latter complaining of increasing harassment by COMPNOR.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The cantina’s real mother lode is information. Depending on who the heroes talk to, they can learn quite a lot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION WORKERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Environmental practices here are not particularly sound. The Empire is literally drilling holes in the giant mesa and dumping its construction debris and trash into them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most of the workers who built the Citadel Inquisitorius have been cycled off Prakith by their employers—on purpose, most suspect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Citadel has entry points at its base and a small landing platform at its top, used by Inquisitors going to and returning from Prak City.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Part of why the Citadel went up so fast is that they found a clearing in the mountains that was perfectly flat and sound enough for a foundation. Who cleared it, they don’t know.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MINERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are four major mining operations in the vicinity of Prak City. The Asonel system is the largest, with multiple mining operations; it is to the north and northwest. To the west and southwest are more modest operations: the Geddis, Herkeath, and Rilkean mines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gems are the most lucrative resource miners get from Prakith’s crust; in some places, they’re plentiful enough to be picked from the cave wall by hand. Of course, someone still must do the work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cave-ins have plagued a lot of mines, making employees for these operations hard to come by. It shouldn’t be too hard for itinerant laborers such as the heroes to sign on with a mining operation. Curiously, at least one, the Geddis operation, is looking for hired muscle as well as miners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To the knowledge of the miners here, none of the cavern systems entered by the major mining operations interconnect, and none comes anywhere near the Magraddor Range (where the Citadel is).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ALIENS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>COMPNOR agents are stepping up the pressure on construction and mining firms to get rid of their non-Human employees.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>COMPNOR agents in Prak City itself have recently begun hassling aliens physically, with the Empire turning a blind eye.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s rumored that COMPNOR agents are literally getting away with murder—a lot of “undesirables” have been disappearing altogether.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There might be a native non-Human population on Prakith. Unusual characters have been seen from time to time, but they dash away as quickly as they’re spotted.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whoever the heroes talk to, they should hear that the best source of information might be the guy who’s been on Prakith the longest, Old Man Geddis. A former miner (and the founder of the Geddis mine), Geddis is drinking his life away in the back room. He knows a lot, but heroes are warned that his liver and mind are in equally poor shape these days.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OLD MAN GEDDIS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>They call him the Old Man, and one look at him shows why: Myrum Geddis looks like he’s spent much of his 70 years either lifting rocks or drilling into them. He probably looked this way at 30. But swilling his drink at a table in the back, Old Man Geddis gives no impression of having been in a mine—or having engaged in any kind of work—in the past year. His days are spent nattering about the phantom creatures he’s seen in the catacombs, and drowning his sorrows. And he has a few: As the heroes can learn by offering Geddis a drink or two, the mine that bears his name is no longer his:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Is Geddis mine a rich claim? “You betcha it is—though it’s tougher’n anythin’ to get the gems outta there. You gotta be real careful not to hit ‘em with the laser-borer too much or you’ll ruin the lot. It’s fine work—y’need organics for that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why couldn’t you make a go of the claim? “I coulda! But I couldn’t afford to hire all the hands I needed t’really get at the good gem veins. And then them Impies come along, givin’ favors t’the Thaarke Corporation. Blast ‘em all!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What’s wrong with the Thaarke Corporation? “They’re scum! Claim-jumpers—and that’s not all. Criminals, the lot of them. And they use slaves when they can find ‘em!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What makes you think there were creatures living underground? “I seen ‘em! At th’ end of a tunnel—I could barely make ‘em out, but they was movin’. Looked for all my years like hairless Wookiees, if y’ask me.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are they looking for more miners out there? “Ye’d help them, even after drinkin’ with me? Pfah! But they’ve taken every lowlife that don’t know how t’tell a gem from a dirtball. I guess they’d take ya.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the discussion, Old Man Geddis sinks into a drunken stupor. Further inquiries about the Thaarke Corporation can be made within the cantina. Most people believe that the firm is a better and more productive steward than Geddis was; at least, plenty of gems are coming out now. Thaarke is hiring miners and security-types for the Geddis mine, and if the heroes are interested, they can visit the recruiting post in the morning. “Just don’t say that Old Man Geddis sent you!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SEEJO AGAIN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Emerging from the cantina after dark, the heroes head up the alley and spy something rolling their way—a metal barrel, bounding down the lane. The can crashes against the side of a building, and a familiar yelp emanates from within the barrel. The lid pops off to reveal none other than Jekk Seejo, dizzy and bruised. Regaining his bearings, Seejo recognizes the heroes. He’s pleased to see them, but fearful of the halfdozen figures coming down the hill. They’re COMPNOR agents, devoted to purging non-Human influences from the Empire. “You drunks stand aside,” the first one yells. “This isn’t your affair!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Seejo, panicking, seems to think that it is. “Don’t let them have me!” When the Good Feeling returned to port, he lost his job, his ship, and, ultimately, any protection he had against COMPNOR. They no longer want him on Prakith, and he fears that they won’t bother deporting him. The agents were rolling him somewhere when the barrel got away. “They’re going to throw me down the Drains,” he says. “Help me!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SAVING SEEJO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the encounter begins, Jekk Seejo has just tumbled down the stone stairs from the top of the map and crashed against the hovel to the south. The COMPNOR supporters descend the stairs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the encounter begins, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The COMPNOR thugs—two, four—no, six!—aren’t happy at all to have outsiders meddling with their fun. “If you like Greenie here,” snarls one, “maybe you can have what he’s having!” This situation has just boiled over. However the COMPNOR thugs do not approach as four Imperial Guard Champions drop down from above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>COMPNOR SUPPOERTERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fanatical COMPNOR supporters—four men and two women—are the least of the threats the Empire has to offer in Prak City, but they have more official sanction here in the Work Zone, and they’re bolder about their actions and their numbers than the heroes have seen previously. The supporters are dressed like any other locals down here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they are attacked for any reason, have them die in a single attack and scatter immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s hard to imagine why anyone would want to make life in the Work Zone of Prak City any harder. However, the miniature mob that’s arrived is more than happy to take out their frustrations on others in the name of the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL SOVEREIGN PROTECTORS (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The newly created Imperial Sovereign Protectors are the elite of the elite Royal Guards. Consisting of Imperial Guard Champions, these particular sovereign protectors are on Prakith to receive Force training, though they have not yet received their training from the Inquisitors. When the COMPNOR agents are attacked, these guards are dispatched to help deal with the situation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These guards look to be garbed in the armor of the Royal Guard, though large sections of their armor are painted black. Each carries a doubleblade and moves with the grace associated with a powerful melee combatant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL GUARD CHAMPION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (heavy exoskeleton) or 20 (knight speed)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 180 (24d8+72)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>19 (+4) 16 (+3) 17 (+3) 17 (+3) 16 (+3) 20 (+5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +7, Con +7, Wis +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities Frightened</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Intimidation +9, Perception +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 17</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 11 (7,200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Innate Forcecasting. The Imperial Guard Champion's innate forcecasting ability is Charisma (force save DC 17, +9 to hit with force powers). It can innately cast the following force powers:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At will: Enfeeble</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3/Day: Fear</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1/Day: Battle Meditation, Phasewalk, Knight Speed</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Choreography of Belligerence.

The Imperial Guard Champion deals an additional weapon die of damage with its weapons (included).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Keen Striking. The Imperial Guard Champion scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If at least one other Imperial Guard is within 5 feet of its target and the ally isn't incapacitated, the creature instead scores a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rally the Troops. As a bonus action, the Imperial Guard Champion can end the charmed and frightened conditions on itself and each creature of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack.

To do so, the Imperial Guard Champion must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL SOVEREIGN PROTECTOR TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The sovereign protectors move quickly into melee so that they can use their doubleblades, trying surround players to take advantage of their bonuses from being around allies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To be added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Down here in the alley after dark, there’s a good chance that a brawl will go unnoticed; the Empire rather expects COMPNOR supporters to start a lot of the fights themselves. Bystanders disappear into the nearby buildings quickly. COMPNOR supporters will quickly try to flee once the player seem to be winning up the stairs on foot, running down a side alley or into the cantina as a last resort. They do not flee to the south, where one of the Drains is, fearing that might give an attacker ideas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes deal with the sovereign protectors, they will need to make haste in their departure. Though the government of Prakith expects trouble from the COMPNOR supporters, they will not take the deaths of four sovereign protectors lightly. However, the Empire’s response will likely be slow, since the local government expects the sovereign protectors to be able to handle themselves and therefore will not have reinforcements nearby.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Seejo, nearly in a panic, directs the heroes to a stinking pit near the construction site. This is one of the Drains, tubes drilled from the Prak City plateau into a recess deep underground; the Empire has been using them to dump garbage (and the odd individual who has outlived his usefulness). This is a fine place to dispose of any bodies, and the heroes will become aware of the Drains as a possible exit from Prak City. This particular tube delivers any bodies (or heroes who chance it) to Location 1 in the “Devourer in the Dark” encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes deliver Seejo from the fate he feared, he invites them to his sad excuse for a dwelling. As Seejo explains, the Good Feeling returned to Prakith’s second moon infested with mynocks (the same swarm that attacked the heroes), resulting in his firing and the loss of his ship. His former employers sent him on the next shuttle to Prakith, but that was no favor. The Duros explains that the Empire has made it impossible for him to make a living, and now he’s at his wit’s end. If he can’t find employment quickly, he’ll be at the mercy of the COMPNOR thugs anywhere he goes on Prak City.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ISeejo asks about the condition of the heroes’ ship. He begs for the tedious assignment of inspecting their vessel in port over the next few days. “Trust me! I’ll have a tool kit this time! I’ll deliver your ship to you, wherever you are!” Seejo seems trustworthy enough, and the heroes know that the security system on their ship is such that he wouldn’t be able to activate the hyperdrive. If the players still turn him down, he mention that he know all the Empire's tricks and can make sure they dont plant any bugs, bombs or any other surprises on the player's ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If hired, Seejo grows chipper again and gives the heroes his comlink ID number before darting off toward the spaceport. (The Duros thus provides a possible means of escape later for heroes in the Citadel. If the heroes refuse his help now, they will have other options for escape from the Citadel, but they will lose the chance at a Destiny reward later.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A SHADOWY FIGURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As another day begins and ends on Prakith, the heroes find their continued presence in Prak City is meeting with diminishing returns. The military areas are unwelcoming, with Inquisitors here and there keeping a watch on this important Imperial asset. Only the miners seem to have any regular access to the area between Prak City and the Magraddor Range. There are meager opportunities to defy the Empire in the Work Zone; the heroes might succeed at a sabotage attempt on a construction site once, but the area will be saturated with Inquisitors thereafter. And reports among the workers say that as more and more of Prak City is up and running, Inquisitor sweeps of the Work Zone are on the increase.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes always have the feeling that they’re being followed, which is confirmed one night in the Work Zone after a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. A shadowy figure darts from cover to cover in the alleys of the Work Zone, keeping an eye on the party. But the instant the heroes spot their follower, they realize it’s not an Inquisitor, but something else.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Spotted, a tall shadow falls back toward a construction area, diving for a crawlspace underneath a parked crane. The figure is as tall as a Wookiee and moves with about as much grace. But for all his height and evident strength, this ruddy-skinned being cowers in terror as you approach—at least, until he gets a better look at you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“You—you!” he says in broken Basic, his sad eyes darting around to see who else is in the area. “You helped the green man. You will help Stereb—you help me!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Herdr’tui, as he calls himself, is a member of the Stereb species, an interstellar race of cave dwellers whose presence on Prakith has been, until now, unknown to the Empire. His Basic vocabulary is very limited; there’s no telling where he picked it up, but Stereb are great mimics. He’s been lost in Prak City for several days, and he seems to have come from below. Imperial drilling on the plateau attracted his attention, as a few inquiries reveal:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Where did you come from? “From Prakith. From inside, where the vital air and fluids nourish the Worldflesh.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How did you get stuck here? “I saw the holes where the parasites were fouling our caverns with their filth. I followed the hidden waters’ flow upward and found a passage to this place. But Prakith was weak, and the footing crumbled.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How long have you been up here in Prak City? “Since I arrived.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why do you trust us? “I saw you help the green man against the people who chased me. You are not of them. Perhaps you are of the stone.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Is there another way to your home? “The pits they have drilled reach there. But I know what awaits below now. I fear to go alone. But with you, perhaps . . .”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why are you hiding here? “I want to go home, to return before it is too late. You cannot leave them untended.

Halt on command of the Inquisitorius!” The Inquisitors are on a routine sweep of the Work Zone for anything out of the ordinary—just to terrorize the locals and remind them the Empire is in charge—and they’ve also been hearing reports of a strange alien lurking around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If this encounter is not triggered earlier in the adventure, the Inquisitor arrives during a random sweep after the heroes meet Herdr’tui.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Place the heroes near the cover area at the center of the map; this represents the hiding place where they find the Stereb. The Inquisitor’s shuttle lands in the slightly raised landing area to the northeast. Whether the heroes stand their ground or not, Herdr’tui immediately runs in terror into the construction site, waving for the heroes to follow him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Soon after the heroes trigger an Inquisitor’s response, the shuttle flies in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That’s something you don’t want to see—an Imperial shuttle coming in over the rooftops of the Work Zone, headed your way.

To this end, he tries to capture Force-users alive, using any form of trickery or subterfuge at his disposal. He is not averse to capturing weaker, non-Force-sensitive heroes to use as hostages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the Inquisitor, they find a code cylinder on him that assists in the entry to Citadel Inquisitorius. Dispatching Jorad, his team, or the shuttle brings a response in the form of another “Prak City Security Force” encounter, so heroes should quickly move to escape the area. Herdr’tui, running to the south at the opening of this encounter, encourages the heroes to enter the Drains with him before seemingly disappearing.. The shuttle can be commandeered, although since it has a tracking device onboard, it will not get far before TIE fighters arrive to ground it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On closer inspection, the heroes see that this is one of the Drains, bore-holes drilled at a sharp (80-degree) angle far down through the rock. Herdr’tui’s distant holler emanates from far below, indicating that he’s slid down quickly and seemingly safely. If the heroes follow him, the tube goes to Location 2 in the “Devourer in the Dark” encounter</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that the heroes do not pursue Herdr’tui, the cavalry arrive for the Empire in the form of a “Prak City Security Force” encounter. Afterward, another one of the Drains beckons, going to Location 3 in the “Devourer in the Dark” encounter. Tussling with COMPNOR agents is one thing, but no one can kill Inquisitors and run for long in the Work Zone. (As a possible variant, Response Team members angered at the deaths of their fellows might toss one or more characters into the Drains as a form of execution—an effective method that has been used before.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: UNDERWORLD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes’ arrival in the sprawling underworld beneath Prakith’s tortured surface is as painful as it is sudden. The disposal tubes are bore-holes drilled at a sharp (80-degree) angle far down through the rock. The rock is sheer and slick with moisture, if the players do not have access to some way to stop their fall, have them take 70 (20d6) kinetic damage from falling so far and colliding onto the debris pile at the bottom of each of the three disposal tubes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That event marks the heroes’ arrival in a vast cavern deep beneath Prak City. This is one of several trash disposal locations for the city and was discovered during early construction. The engineers decided that it would be far more economical to simply dump waste down into the cavern, which even at maximum use would take generations to fill. Even better, there’s a living garbage disposal down here in the form of the greethka, a massive beast that devours trash. It’s a surprisingly environmental solution, if an accidental one, and the cavern also provides the Empire with a means for the disposal of unwanted beings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DEVOURER IN THE DARK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes arrive abruptly, sliding at high speed down one of three steeply slanted (80-degree) bore-holes from above. Heroes entering from the tube at the construction site in Prak City arrive at Location 1 or Herdr’tui and heroes entering from immediately after the “Curious Inquisitor” encounter arrive at Location 2. Location 3 can be used for any if you wish. Each location features a 15-feet-high pile of garbage and other debris. Locations 1 and 2 are infested by ratlike dinkos; Location 3 is closest to the greethka’s watery lair.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Herdr’tui arrives with the heroes, he immediately begins to retreat toward whatever cavern wall he is closest to, seeking higher ground. He wants to stay away from the giant greethka.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once all the heroes enter one of the Drains, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You rocket down the slick chute before tumbling into a wet pile of garbage. It’s a painful landing, but no one seems to have followed you—nor should they, since this cavern looks like nothing more than a great stomach, with glowing bioluminescent slime dripping from the ceiling. Water trickles into the cavern off a collapsed pile of rocks to the north, collecting into a large green pool before washing out a black exit to the south. Below the ends of the chutes above lie massive hummocks of trash, waiting as if to be digested by something. Noises echo through the chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GREETHKA (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Motile slimes, molds, and jellies are well suited to life in the subterranean wilderness of Prakith. Many live on the heat and energy provided by the lava and magma of the underworld, but others have adapted and evolved to take advantage of other resources, whether organic or inorganic. The gelatinous masses known to the Stereb as greethka eat everything.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Normal adult greethka grow to about 5 feet in width, a perfect size for oozing through the passages of Prakith. They vary in shape from a glistening, bulging sphere to a flat, slimy pancake, depending on what they’re digesting. In any form, they can extrude one to three 3-squarelong pseudopods from any section of their body, with which they grab and pin their food source. Wild greethka prefer to live in large placid ponds fed by underground waters, but sometimes they live in fast-moving rivers through which they swim, as fast as a fish, in a wormlike form. They are greenish-brown in color and slightly translucent; large globules (often remains of recent repasts) float at random within their bodies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes learn later if they quiz Herdr’tui, the greethka in this cavern is an aberration. Greethka whose diets are not regulated grow uncontrollably.

He points at the greethka’s fading nucleus, still gently pulsating within the sickening ooze, and begins repeating a phrase that defies translation. Any hero making a successful DC 15 Intelligence check divines that Herdr’tui is interested in seeing the nucleus retrieved. This may not seem like a sensible act at first, especially given what’s just happened, but a hero willing to brave the guck and get his or her hands dirty by retrieving the nucleus will find the experience rewarding later on. Herdr’tui takes the nucleus—a ball the size of a Human infant—and holds it gently, murmuring softly to the thing. The nucleus begins purring and glowing more warmly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whatever happens to the greethka, Herdr’tui awkwardly explains that the creature originally belonged to him. Leading the heroes through the hip-deep water where the stream exits through the southern tunnel, Herdr’tui points out a similarly dressed Stereb in the passageways up ahead. The Stereb is coaxing along a greethka only a few feet across, far smaller than the one that threatened the heroes. Herdr’tui, as his given name suggests, is a herder, charged by his people with tending to the macabre greethka. With a herder to manage the creatures’ diet, the Stereb can keep the greethkas moving slowly and consuming unwanted debris, thus performing a useful function for their society. But when Herdr’tui tracked his lost greethka to the debris cavern, he found that the creature had gorged on Imperial trash to the point where it had become wild and unruly to manage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Leading the heroes through smooth-surfaced tunnels populated by surprised Stereb stoneworkers, Herdr’tui explains that he had worked his way alone upstream, hoping to find where the trash was coming from, when he was captured by Imperial workers sealing off that entrance to the cavern. Unrestrained, the greethka gorged on everything the Imperials could throw away. By removing the still-living nucleus from the slain greethka, the heroes will permit Herdr’tui to raise a proper-sized creature again, thus saving his livelihood. Either way, Herdr’tui owes his life to the heroes, and the Stereb civilians now gawking at the strange visitors take the long-missing herder’s presence as an endorsement of the newcomers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE NERVE CENTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Herdr’tui leads the heroes into an underground grotto. Luminescent stalagmites hang from the ceiling, dripping a greenish dew and providing light for the room. This is clearly an important area to the Stereb culture—the nerve center of this community (in more ways than one, as the heroes will see). There are eight tunnels leading into the Grotto and eight rubble piles in the center of the room. Each 5 feet high, the rubble piles include pebbles and larger fist-sized rocks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Herdr’tui calls out into the emptiness, and, moments later, eight withered and shrunken Stereb enter, one through each of the eight entrances. That includes the entrance Herdr’tui led the heroes through; the heroes are not entirely sure how or when that particular elder female Stereb entered the tunnel behind them. Herdr’tui nods graciously to that figure, indicating his fealty to her. The aged Stereb settle atop the eight rubble piles as if they were sitting on beanbags. The piles are horribly uncomfortable for anyone else, but the Stereb seem to find this kind of furniture completely acceptable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Herdr’tui stands before his leader, whose name is Eldr’har, and recounts recent events in the Stereb language. The exposition is drawn out and ponderous; there’s no use for speedy storytelling when you’re a Stereb with all the time in the world and no place to go. Eldr’har acts as if she’s already aware of the information somehow and addresses the heroes in broken Basic:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“You are not a part of us. Yet you have brought a part of us back to us. You are not harmful to Prakith—you have helped Prakith. There is so much illness to Prakith—we are beset with it. We hope you have come to this place to help Prakith further.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eldr’har speaks solemnly, always using plural pronouns; while Stereb are individuals with specialized tasks, they don’t seem to have particularly strong egos. Eldr’har invites questions from the heroes. Below are answers to some questions they might ask:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Who are the Stereb? “We are of the stone. We belong to Prakith, its walls, and its vessels.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have the Stereb always been here? “That’s a strange question. Where else would we be?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are you connected to the Stereb on other planets? “Other planets? There are other planets? Prakith is all!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are you in charge here? “All here serve Prakith. We all have our function. We elders know the function best.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How is Stereb society constructed? “We all have our function. The Herders, like Herdr’tui, clear debris. The Hewers work the passages, keeping them open. The Feeders tend to us all. All of us are important to Prakith.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What do you think of the Imperial presence above? “All that is of Prakith, belongs. That which is outside is not a part of us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What do you think of the mining activity? “There is a cancer on Prakith. We were created to protect against it. But the cancer moves too fast. We can but slow its progress.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Do you know a way into the Citadel? “We do not know what you are talking about.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes who succeed on DC 22 Intelligence (Lore) check recognize that the Stereb are not local, but part of a race that has been encountered on other worlds previously. If the players roll above a 25, they additionally recall specific details of their presence elsewhere: While the Stereb have lived on the surface of rocky planets, erecting stone buildings and monuments, their true presence is underground, in the great catacombs they have hewn. It is impossible to divine the original Stereb homeworld; they do not seem to know, themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Understanding the true nature of Stereb society requires a multidisciplinary approach and almost certainly requires the pooling of the heroes’ skills. A successful DC 20 Intelligence check with advantage as players pool their knowledge reveals that the Stereb consider the world they are on to be a living entity (even though, in truth, it is not). The Stereb believe that they are literally the planet’s antibodies: microorganisms living symbiotically with the rocky world, responsible for its care. That extends to clearing tunnel blockages to improve the planet’s “circulation” of air and water, keeping the effects of erosion uniform, and above all, respecting the surface environment, which seems to be the source of the “illness” Eldr’har describes. Stereb society breaks down into roughly eight different sectors, all corresponding to various imagined autonomic systems within Prakith’s planet-sized “anatomy.” Herders, such as Herdr’tui, direct their creatures to clear away foreign matter from the planet’s tunnels; Hewers keep the tunnels safe and clear; Feeders harvest the lichens to sustain the Stereb.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any attempt to disabuse Eldr’har or the other Stereb of the notion that Prakith is a living entity, or that they are part of the planetary immune system, results in reduced cooperation, but only by a matter of degree. The Stereb are generally compliant and slow to anger, reacting only in response to an immediate threat. Words do not offend them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>EXERCISING A TUMOR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Stereb seem eager (eager for them, anyway) to entertain their visitors. It isn’t something they get to do very often. This is a good time for the heroes to rest and recuperate, although the toasted fungus the Stereb serve might not sit well with many stomachs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eldr’nol, the youngest male of the elder eight, takes a particular interest in the newcomers. Eldr’nol and his followers are responsible for the logistical needs of the tribe: keeping tabs on where the tunnelers need to go, what the lichen harvesters are doing, and—importantly for the heroes—the big picture of the surface and underworld. Eldr’nol proudly demonstrates a huge slab painted with many phosphorescent hues, which represents the Stereb map of their world as they know it. This is the petrigram, “the Worldflesh set in stone.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eldr’nol does not recognize references to the Citadel Inquisitorius, Prak City, or anywhere else aboveground unless the heroes provide some kind of geographic context. Human structures are basically all alike to the Stereb, but they do know what the Prak City plateau above them looks like, as well as the Magraddor Range, the mountainous area where the Citadel is. (Granted, the Stereb mostly know it from below, but enough of their kind have reached the surface for mappers to recognize its terrain.) With patience, the heroes can piece together where they are in relationship to the Stereb map and where the surface features are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The cavern system near Prak City goes much farther than the Empire’s records or mining surveys suggest. The Prakithian crust includes large swaths of minerals that make sonic and gravitic surveys of cave systems unreliable. (Many of those same minerals are what make the planet so attractive to miners.) Importantly, the petrigram depicts a second extensive cave system to the west, near the Geddis mining operation seen from orbit. Other veins stretch even farther west from that, tantalizingly close to the Magraddor Range—and the Citadel—more than a hundred kilometers away. That portion of the petrigram is dusty and worn, as if it has not been referred to or updated in many years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The closest approach of the Prak City Stereb Network (as the heroes might well call it) to the Geddis cave system is only a day’s spelunk away, but it might as well be light years. As Eldr’nol explains, the Stereb themselves closed the only connecting passage:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Sister Eldr’har spoke true. A cancer has come to our Prakith. On the flesh, as with those who took our herder son, and in the flesh, as well. What you see inscribed in stone is the record of a desperate act, but an act of love, to save Prakith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“When the parasites first arrived, we did not know what they were. We hoped they were like us—the Stereb, the greethka, all of us who are part of the whole. But when they took to burrowing, we found they were of another. Foreign bodies, with no respect for Prakith and a danger to the system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“None alive forgets when their sound-makers and light-makers entered our world. Hundreds of Stereb were at work in what you call the Geddis caves, tending Prakith as is our purpose. The parasites took our cousins and turned them against that purpose, forcing them to join in ravaging our planet’s hide. They became part of the cancer, and we had no choice but to amputate.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It should be apparent from Eldr’nol’s speech and the petrigram that the Stereb are referring to miners who entered the caverns and enslaved the inhabitants, forcing the rest of the Stereb to collapse the only connecting tunnel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Stereb elders must be persuaded that the Geddis Stereb can be restored to their society because their behavior has been only temporarily changed by their new masters. This is a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check because the heroes are up against what is an article of faith for the Stereb—that their enslaved cousins have been turned into parasites ravaging the planet. Players who learned about the culture of the Strereb have advantage on this check. Additionally, if the heroes recognized the importance of the greethka nucleus to Herdr’tui and rose above their disgust to retrieve it, the herder Stereb now relates that story to the elders in their own language, lowering the DC to 25.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes succeed in persuading the elders, a workforce of 20 able-bodied Stereb escorts them the day’s walk to the westernmost terminus, where an engineered cave-in prevents access to the labyrinth under the Geddis mine. Working faster than the heroes might imagine anyone could manage with primitive tools, the Stereb clear a Humansized passage through the blockage. However, they will not follow the heroes into the unknown. The Stereb will follow only after the heroes inform them that the areas ahead have been secured. They are workers, not warriors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes fail to persuade the Stereb to lead them to the cave-in, Herdr’tui encourages them to go it alone, using the directions they have already gleaned from the petrigram. This lengthens the trip to five days, since the heroes do not have the Sterebs’ skill at tunneling under challenging conditions. But the Stereb admire their devotion to the task, which is a matter of great merit in their society.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE EXCLAVE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes break through the collapsed rubble separating the two Stereb labyrinths, read the following description aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is a rush of air, and you are surprised by its foulness. The Stereb labyrinth behind you had been musty, but fresh air still flowed, perhaps due in some way to the glowing lichens. Here, there is nothing but the stench of bodies living in cramped quarters with no hope of escape. A light shines up ahead, but whatever lives here must not have much of a life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes enter an octagonal room currently serving as the Stereb slave quarters. If the players were not particularly stealthy, they provoke a panicked response from one of the Stereb occupants, attracting the attention of the guards in nearby command post to the west. These guards however while willing to do anything for a paycheck are of little threat to the players and should not be treated as such, they'll fold to most arguments or threats as the players look almost exactly like the bounties placed on people who killed Imperial Sovereign Protectors and Inquisitors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players prefer to be stealthy, they attract the attention of a teenage Stereb girl, Helr’ven. She is serving as a nurse for the eight Stereb under her care in the slave quarters. All of them are in pretty bad shape from overwork and mining-related injuries, and she’s taken this duty because everyone older is gone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the months since the Stereb blocked the passage, Helr’ven has not seen anyone enter from that direction. Her spirits, raised by the thought that her people have returned, fall immediately when she sees the heroes, whom she assumes must be more miners. Since the other Stereb won’t have followed the heroes in, Helr’ven begins the meeting with an attitude of unfriendly. The heroes must quietly move her to being friendly with them, a DC 23 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convincing her that they are not miners who have wiped out the Stereb on the other side of the divide. If she can’t be convinced, she raises an alarm that brings in the guards as mentioned above. However she will come around as the guards are unlikely to acknowledge the players and scuttle off to get significantly stronger forces to deal with them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If convinced, Helr’ven grows tearfully happy and becomes a useful source of information, responding to questions quietly so as not to alert those to the west:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How many are you? “Eight left. There were fourteen working the mine but they died earlier today. We are so few now.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Who is holding you? “The foreign bodies—those like you—hold us with their lightmakers and sound-makers. They destroy, destroy, nothing but destroy.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How many are they? “Two just outside, I think. They come and go. They have made their station in the chamber beyond, where they send our workers out from.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How many access points are there to the surface? “I don’t know anything about that, but the foreigners arrived by breaking through one of our tunnels and have since added three more.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How strong are they? “Very strong. Stronger than us. They even have things seemingly made of rock that spit fire. And they have brought pestilence, large and small.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Can we expect help from your people? “We are few, and so sick. They work us until we die. But we are with you in spirit.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Do you know how to reach the Citadel in the Magraddor Range? “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Helr’ven urges the heroes to take the sickly Stereb back through the eastern passage. This is a fairly complicated enterprise and requires a DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check, representing the players removing a Stereb, a failed check gains the attention of the guards. Helr’ven will not leave her patients and will follow them where they go.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A PATH TO THE PAST</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the miners have been incapacitated or driven out of the Geddis mine and the elevator disabled, a happy and tearful reunion occurs between the two Stereb colonies. The Prak City Stereb widen the passageway and tend to their ailing cousins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now far more receptive to the heroes’ interests, the Stereb offer to share all they know about the caverns between here and the Magraddor Range, where the Citadel stands. Consulting first with a haggard survivor from the Geddis mine, Eldr’nol joins the heroes in the chamber that was the miners’ command station—a gallery of sorts, with pictograms on the walls. Removing a particular stone from the south side of the western wall, Eldr’nol opens a secret passage 15 feet wide leading off to the west. The control for the secret door is well hidden—the miners never found it—and heroes on their own would have to make a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check to find it. Inside the hidden chamber, Eldr’nol shows the heroes another petrigram map. A long, narrow Stereb passage leads to a network that extends close to the Magraddor Range. Eldr’nol speaks:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“You are not of Prakith, but your actions show that you are truly born anew of Prakith. Know, then, the secret kept here. The Stereb have been here longer than memory and have tended far more of the Worldflesh than outsiders know. This tunnel leads to a large system where, in ancient times, our forefolk worked far and wide, and even to the mountains you ask of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The way is far—many, many days’ walk—and you will find, as they did, that the waters have overtaken much of the way. Death for Stereb lies that way. I cannot know if this affects such as you, but if the peaks are your destination, you will find that we have already worked the roots.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A relatively easy DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check enables the heroes to evaluate the western tunnel in relation to the petrigram and realize that more than 60 miles of tunnels separate them from the Magraddor Range. With relation to other surface features, it neatly splits the area between the Geddis mining operation and the Rilkean mines, farther to the southwest. The heroes also realize that the tunnel leading ahead is wide enough to allow the passage of a single speeder bike which the hired miners often leave around speeder bikes while mining.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eldr’nol’s knowledge comes in handy during questioning</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are the tunnels all as wide as this one? “If they remain open, yes. Sometimes they are wider—much wider. The Stereb lived there for a long time and expended great efforts to perfect Prakith’s flesh. Some are long and narrow, but none should be impassible.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What did you mean when you said the waters had taken over? “The tale is a sad one. Prakith wept, and the tears came down from the mountains and through our passages. Prakith did not favor the work of the Stereb there, and much of our network collapsed into an underground sea. Many Stereb were swallowed in the cataclysm. Since, we have worked to do better by Prakith.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are the tunnels completely flooded? “I have not visited the place since as a boy, when the waters crested a Stereb’s height. But we know nothing of travel and water—in, under, or above it. I would fear to go.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Are there exits from the tunnels? Do the tunnels reach the part of the range where the Citadel rises? “I do not know this Citadel, but the Stereb of old often dug pores to the surface within mountains to vent Prakith’s fevers and provide air for our workers. Could any be there, so far away? None can know.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes should realize that they’re on their own in any underground assault through the abandoned Magraddor tunnels, and that the speeder bikes represent the way there and across any water barrier in something less than an eternity. It seems foolish to assault the Citadel aboveground, where the skies and surface are strictly monitored and Inquisitors can sense Force-users for kilometers around. Underground, however, the heroes might have a chance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eldr’nol is sad to see the heroes go, but hopeful that they will find what they’re seeking. He encourages them to make their own copy of the petrigram so they won’t get lost.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Stereb provide what meager provisions they can for your journey as you prepare to leave. Although Eldr’nol’s imagination has clearly been captured by your expedition, he can only stand by sadly and wave to his new friends. It is not for the Stereb to have adventures. Others might think of the stars, but the Stereb serve the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE UNDERGROUND SEA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The journey to the Underground Sea is a long one—more than 60 miles to the point where the flooded chambers start. The passage is a mixture of Stereb stonework and natural caverns, containing a lot of sharp turns and abrupt changes in elevation. The tunnels have not been occupied in years, so although some glowing lichen grows naturally in spots, no attempt has been made to cultivate it at regular intervals. It’s pretty much headlights or nothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The trip takes two and a half hours assuming they have speeder bikes or twenty hours if they are simply walking. If they are on speeder bikes have them make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check at the start of their journey to keep track of any dangerous walls or stalactites. If they fail the check, an obstacle in their way at some point during the ride causes an accident, dealing 99 (18d10) kinetic damage from the collision or accident. It is assumed that players walking there are no going fast enough to have an issue.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter the Underground Sea area, they might not realize immediately that they’ve arrived. Puddles appear below, separated by higher ground. Ankle-deep water stands in another several kilometers of hallways. Then it grows darker as the sparse lichen on the walls disappears, and soon the walls and the ground disappear, as well. Read the following description aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There were walls here, once, and floors. But it’s all gone now, collapsed under the weight of the floodwaters. Who knows how many Stereb chambers stood here? Now, the sea below has claimed them all, and the water is too close for comfort because the surface above remains, its irregular shape hanging like a curtain to catch speeders who come too close.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes approach the Underground Sea, set them up on one side of the map in knee-deep water.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes cross the Underground Sea, read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Low ceiling above, murky water below. No light, cavern walls that close in suddenly and then widen to nothingness. Stalactites, roots— this is no place to come for a vacation. All that, plus a deep, nagging feeling of foreboding and dread.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>gray fear moss clings to the ceiling in the bottleneck. Inquisitors in the Citadel do not detect any Force powers used by the party near the moss, which emits a dark Force presence over a large enough area to mask anything the heroes do. A successful DC 25 Wisdom check or DC 25 Charisma check made by a forcecasting player automatically alerts the heroes of the creature’s presence when they are within 1 mile of it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the gray fear moss is within visual range, heroes can notice it by making a successful DC 30 Wisdom (Perception) check made at disadvantage due to the dim light in the cavern.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GRAY FEAR MOSS (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A relative of the fear mosses living on more verdant planets, the gray fear moss has adapted well to Prakith’s subterranean environment. Prey underground is scarce, and these mosses have developed the ability to descend into a Force trance, similar to the Morichro technique practiced by some Jedi, to slow their metabolism during long periods of fasting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fear moss feeds off its prey’s bodily juices, being particularly fond of adrenaline and other fear-induced chemicals. Once captured in the tentacles of the moss, the prey is exposed to a mind-altering toxin that induces an extreme state of fear. The specimen in this cavern is much larger than most as a result of its exposure to the dark forces emanating from the Citadel Inquisitorius above.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As soon as the heroes perceive (or are attacked by) the creature, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A thin, grayish-white, flaky mass is spread across a large section of the ceiling. Its cryptic coloration nearly matches that of its environment, with only a slightly rougher texture to distinguish it from the surrounding stone. Five long tentacles hang down from this mass into the water below, resembling the other stalactites in the cave system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GREY FEAR MOSS TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gray fear moss knows patience. It allows the heroes to approach until as many as possible are directly beneath its body mass before making grappling attacks with each of its tentacles (one tentacle per opponent). If there are more than five characters in the party, the fear moss attacks with only the outer four tentacles, leaving the fifth tentacle available to make slam attacks against any heroes who try to free other characters caught in its grapple attacks</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GREY FEAR MOSS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gargantuan plant, unaligned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 705 (30d20+300)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 10 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>30 (+10) 16 (+3) 30 (+10) 3 (-4) 16 (+3) 17 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Perception +17</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities blinded, frightened, prone</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 27</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 24 (62,000 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>False Appearance.

The gray fear moss can attack up to five times with its tentacles or, if it has a grappled creature, tentacle slam.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8+10) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 21) and restrained until the grapple ends. The gray fear moss has five tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tentacle Slam The gray fear moss slams grappled creatures into itself. Each creature must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (4d8+10) poison damage and frightened for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half the poison damage and isn't frightened. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mental Lure. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the gray fear moss that is not immune to charm must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the lure ends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gray fear moss must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue the lure. It can stop the mental lure at any time. The lure ends if the gray fear moss is incapacitated. While charmed by the gray fear moss, a target is incapacitated and ignores the lures of other gray fear moss. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the gray fear moss, the target must move on its turn toward the gray fear moss by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the gray fear moss, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this gray fear moss's lure for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The gray fear moss magically emits psychic energy. Creatures of the gray fear moss’ choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 27 (5d10) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEGENDARY ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gray fear moss can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The moss regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Attack. The gray fear moss makes one tentacle or slam attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exert Will. One creature charmed must use its reaction to move up to its speed or to make a weapon attack against a target as designated by the gray fear moss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Corrupting Touch (Costs 2 Actions). Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 24 (4d6+ 10) poison damage, and the target is slimed. Until the slime is scraped off with an action, the target is poisoned, and any creature, other than an ooze, is poisoned while within 10 of the target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The is only 15 feet between the ceiling where the grey fear moss is and the surface of the water.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Escaping the fear moss, the heroes advance to the far northern end of the Underground Sea. True to Eldr’nol’s speculation, the Stereb tunnels begin to reappear, first as fixtures rising from the water, and finally as passageways leading from the destroyed underwater section. Once in the dry tunnels, the heroes find that the stonework is much more detailed than what they saw in the other Stereb tunnels. This was one of their ancient haunts, and clearly an important one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note: This should be considered a levelup milestone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Twenty miles of tunnels lie ahead, and after the first 10, no further travel by speeder bike is possible. For the first time, the heroes encounter stairs, which lead up through an angling, turning passageway that no bike can navigate. Even minor Force sensitivity is enough to reveal that the passageway leads not upward to the light, but to someplace very dark: an approach to the base of the Citadel Inquisitorius, nestled in the Magraddor Range. The fear moss was attracted to the Underground Sea by the Citadel’s presence, feeding off the dark side energy. But at the same time, the moss cloaked the heroes’ approach. It’s a security flaw the Citadel certainly would do something about—that is, if the Inquisitors had any notion of the extent of the tunnels under the Magraddor Range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes climb higher and higher through the dark staircases, it becomes increasingly important for Force-users to shield their thoughts. Three kilometer-long underground staircases stand between the heroes and a Stereb-constructed stone “pore,” not far from the foundation of the towering black spire of the Citadel, but reaching the pore undetected will be challenging. At the beginning of each staircase, Force-sensitive PCs must make a Wisdom or Charisma check to avoid being detected by an Imperial Inquisitor, adding proficiency if they are proficient in the Deception skill. DC 20 for the first staircase, DC 25 for the second, and DC 30 for the third. The increasing difficulty reflects the heroes’ proximity to the Citadel and their distance from the underground field of fear moss. A failed check results in a welcoming party appearing when the heroes emerge—an early activation of the “Citadel Security Team” encounter, listed in Part 3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: INTO THE CITADEL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes get their first glimpse of Citadel Inquisitorius from nearby, most likely when they emerge from the catacombs, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is night in the Magraddor Range, which is appropriate, since the Citadel Inquisitorius is a thing out of nightmares. A towering spire rises into the Prakith sky, a black-on-black vision of dread. Faint lights glow weakly from the higher levels. This is a place of dark acts, where the only light employed is that necessary to advance the Emperor’s aims.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In contrast to the obsidian monolith above, the plaza around the Citadel seems almost organic. Ancient. That’s impossible, given the recent arrival of the Empire, but nonetheless, it is so. Cracked and dusty pavement surrounds the Citadel base, punctuated at the sides by eight intricate stone columns a three hundred feet high. Dwarfed by the much taller Citadel at the plaza’s center, these ornately decorated cylinders seem mystical in their arrangement, like an ancient sundial. One of Prakith’s moons shines above, half eclipsed by the Citadel. This is a place for things of the night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes came through the Stereb tunnels, they emerge from an overgrown, crumbled opening just below the base of one of the stone columns. These are the “pores” of which Eldr’nol spoke: Each of the Stereb columns rises from deep underground, and, if the heroes saw them from the air, they’d recognize the columns as something akin to smokestacks. The Stereb built the circle of columns here centuries ago, and Imperial architects took advantage of the paved clearing within the mountains to build the Citadel. Aesthetics played a role, as well; locating amid the ancient ruins appealed to the architects’ dark side sensibilities. (Indeed, there is a remote chance that Darth Andeddu brought the Stereb to Prakith as enslaved builders in the first place, centuries ago, although this is only a possibility.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is not difficult to scale the building-block stonework to the surface of the plaza, and the approach by night is a lucky break. The plaza is not the source of much activity even in daytime. Because of the Stereb columns, most larger transports serve the Citadel from a platform near the top of the spire. A circular colonnade surrounds the base, with access points to the Citadel underneath the obsidian canopy, but in the dark it’s hard to determine the best route inside. There is some cover available for anyone who tries to approach the Citadel’s base on foot, but with occasional patrols and meditating Inquisitors, the heroes will need to make an important decision.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A fast dash under the colonnade requires a single DC 30 Dexterity (Stealth) check; failure initiates the “Citadel Security Team” (CST) encounter and puts the Citadel on high alert. If the heroes make the check or if they defeat the defenders, they must then make a DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check with advantage if they have an Inquisitor’s code cylinder to activate the elevator. A failed check brings another CST encounter; a success allows the heroes to advance to Route 1 under “Reaching the Top”. This is the least ideal method of entry, but it’s the cost of impatience, to a degree. (It’s an administrative entrance, and it hits the most chokepoints on the way to Master Denia.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pausing to reconnoiter puts the heroes in the position of making a DC 20 Dexterity Stealth check, this covers surveying the area and advancing, which might trigger a security team. But a success gives the heroes the option of two more points of entry.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Prisoners’ Entrance: The first point is an intimidating-looking archway that leads through a gargoyle-decorated passage toward an elevator. This is the “perp walk” route for new prisoners, and while it offers the most direct route to the top (Route 2), it’s designed to look very threatening. To enter this way, the heroes must make a DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check with advantage if they have an Inquisitor’s code cylinder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Service Entrance: The second point of entry, not too far away, is what appears to be a seldom-used service elevator with a control panel. This elevator leads to Route 3, which takes the heroes past the training center. To enter this way, the heroes must make a DC 26 Intelligence (Technology) check with advantage if they have an Inquisitor’s code cylinder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes cannot activate the elevators until any outstanding CST encounters triggered by their actions are resolved. The Citadel will not put the elevators into lockdown while they’re still running Response Teams downstairs. This is new to them—nobody’s ever been crazy enough to assault the Citadel before.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CITADEL SECURITY TEAM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Citadel Security Teams monitor the grounds outside the base of the Citadel and make periodic sweeps. The plaza outside is wide and flat with columns nearer the entry to the Citadel, so Game Masters can use any map, establishing cover as desired.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Citadel Security Teams monitor the supply shipments and vehicles going in and out from the base of the Citadel and handle periodic ground sweeps. With Prakith becoming more important to the Empire and Imperial Sovereign Protectors being trained here, they are being used to scare any potential escapees or people attempting to smuggling things in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the Security Team faces defeat, it attempts to fall back to the Citadel, where they try to upload a holorecording of the fight to the Citadel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL SOVEREIGN PROTECTOR (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL GUARD CHAMPION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (heavy exoskeleton) or 20 (knight speed)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 180 (24d8+72)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>19 (+4) 16 (+3) 17 (+3) 17 (+3) 16 (+3) 20 (+5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +7, Con +7, Wis +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities Frightened</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Intimidation +9, Perception +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 17</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 11 (7,200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Innate Forcecasting.

Ascending the stairs, they find an octagonal atrium that is 100 feet from ceiling to floor. Suspended high above the center is a platform where Inquisitor Draco and his droids are abusing Master Denia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes emerge from the elevator into an octagonal room, the torture chamber. This two-level area, at the peak of the tower just below the landing pad level, has an atrium below and a space meters above where Valin Draco and his droids are torturing Denia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes enter the lower level of the torture room through an elevator located in the central pillar. This pillar supports a disc 15 feet above them where the torture apparatus is located. The disc extends another 10 feet past the central pillar on all sides, so unless someone on the disc walks to the edge and peers underneath, the heroes have total cover in the space immediately adjacent to the pillar.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How is it possible to feel hot and cold at the same time? Yet that’s how it feels here in the dragon’s maw, Draco’s torture chamber. You can hear Denia’s screams from above. She doesn’t have much time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Upon exiting the elevator, the heroes must make DC 26 Dexterity (Stealth) checks so that Draco does not hear them enter the area. Across from the elevator, two elevating platforms—scaffoldlike ledges on a hydraulic lift— run up to a catwalk that extends 15 feet out from the wall around the perimeter of the room. The catwalk has a 3 feet high railing around it; the railing does not provide cover, but it might help prevent someone from being pushed off the side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two openings exist in the railing across the room from each other. These are where the catwalks can be extended outward to reach the central platform. Currently, each accessway is retracted into its niche under the perimeter catwalk, isolating the platform. The control panels to extend and retract the accessways are in the perimeter wall across the catwalk from each accessway opening. A third control panel exists on the torture platform at the foot of the examination table. No skill check is needed to activate a control panel, unless someone at another panel is trying to send a counter-command. If this occurs, both characters must make opposed Intelligence (Technology) checks. The command of the successful check will be followed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The torture apparatus on the central platform consists of a 3-feet tall examination table in the center of the platform. Master Denia is strapped to the table. Standing next to it are two T0-D interrogation droids on their wheeled chassis; Draco stands at Denia’s feet. The torture platform has no railing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes are recognized, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Denia looks up, beaten and broken, and recognizes you. “I knew . . . you . . . would come.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco stands and looks down. He’s changed—cybernetically. “I knew you would come, too. I don’t know how you made it here, but I’m better than I was before. This time, things will end differently!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Decked out in heavy duty armour, Valin Draco looks different from when the heroes last saw him. He’s been cybernetically enhanced, with a glowing eye giving him a more evil look than before, if that’s possible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When he becomes aware of the heroes, Draco taunting his foes and uses his Force powers aggressively, trying to whittle the heroes down at a distance before engaging them in melee combat. He tries to knock the heroes off the catwalks or into the walls using telekinetic force powers, or damage them directly. He attempts to disarm opponents of their most powerful weapons and takes out any character who he knows possesses the capability to damage his cybernetics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Draco is reduced to 0 hitpoints, instead is reduced to 1 hitpoint and he turns to the heroes and says, “You may have defeated me today, but you’ll not win your prize!” Then he turns toward the near-comatose Master Denia and hits her with Force lightning. However, Denia has one last act left within her; with valiant effort, she reflects the lightning back upon her foe. As the lightning arcs back and forth between the combatants, Denia collapses onto the examination table. Draco, obviously weakened further, glares at the heroes, then runs or leaps up the ramp to the floors above with the Force.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, it appears that one of the heroes is going to perish in this battle against Draco, Master Denia summons one last rush of energy and attacks Draco with the Force. Reflecting the Force energy back at one another, both Denia and Draco are seriously wounded. The Jedi collapses while Draco escapes (as described above).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The control panels for the accessways can be destroyed. Destroying a control panel freezes the accessway in its current position.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note: The map shows where the catwalks would be when extended, even though both catwalks are retracted at the beginning of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid, lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 20 (Heavy Exoskeleton + Cybernetics)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 276 (29d8+145)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>22 (+6) 16 (+3) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 20 (+5) 24 (+7)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +13, Con +12, Wis +12, Cha +14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +13, Acrobatics +10, Intimidaion +14, Lore +14, Perception +12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances kinetic and energy damage from enhanced weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities lightning</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Immunities kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities charmed, frightened</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive perception 22</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 23 (50,000 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Legendary Resistance (3/day). If Valin Draco fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting. Valin Draco is an 18th-level forcecaster. Valin Draco’s forcecasting ability is Charisma (power save DC 22, +14 to hit with force attacks) and it has 87 force points. Valin Draco knows the following force powers:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At-will: affect mind, denounce, feedback, force push/pull, necrotic charge, saber reflect</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1st-level: force jump, improved feedback, sap vitality, wound</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2nd-level: darkness, drain vitality, force sight, force throw</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3rd-level: choke, force lightning, force scream, knight speed, sever force</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4th-level: drain life, force immunity, improved force camouflage, shroud of darkness</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5th-level: greater feedback, improved force scream, improved phase strike, telekinesis</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6th-level: crush, force chain lightning</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7th-level: force lightning cone, ruin</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8th-level: death field</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Resistance. Valin Draco has advantage on saving throws against force powers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pinpoint Power. When Valin Draco casts a power that allows it to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw, Valin Draco can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Quickened Power. When Valin Draco casts a power that has a casting time of 1 action, it can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cybernetic Enhancements. Valin Draco wears armor reinforced by cybernetic enhancements. Valin Draco is immune to damage from unenhanced sources, and has resistance to damage from enhanced weapons. If Valin Draco takes ion damage, this trait does not function until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regeneration. Valin Draco regains 25 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If Valin Draco takes ion damage this trait does not function until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack. Valin Draco makes four melee attacks, or casts a power and makes a melee attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Martial Lightsaber. Melee Weapon Attack: Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8+6) energy damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEGNEDARY ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Valin Draco can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Valin Draco regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At-Will Power. Valin Draco casts an at-will power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Move. Valin Draco moves up to its speed without provoking attacks of oppurtunity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting (1 legendary action per power level). Valin Draco can cast a force power by spending a number of legendary actions equal to the power level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Deathblow (Costs 3 Actions). Valin Draco makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, Valin Draco deals maximum damage, and the target cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ANOTHER DISTRESS CALL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Watching Draco depart from the landing platform atop the Citadel, the heroes realize that their journey is at an end, in more ways than one. A few hours of darkness remain, but the Citadel is alight with activity below—everyone they might have missed on the way up is now working to secure the facility.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most likely means of escape comes from Jekk Seejo. After contacting the heroes, Seejo waits an appropriate amount of time in orbit and places another distress call. But this call is fake. It announces that his ship is out of control and heading for the surface. Somewhere, Imperial controllers, recognizing Seejo’s voice, engage in headslaps. Not again!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes see their ship approaching from the sky at high speed, only to level out in midair near the top of the Citadel just before striking the mountains. Unable to land on the platform that Draco departed from—the winds are high, and Seejo isn’t great in the landing department—the Duros brings the ship to a position just beside and below a jutting surface of the platform. Each hero must make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to jump the 15 feet down, taking falling damage against the ship’s roof if they fail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Comlink chatter should indicate some degree of confusion; the Empire is at a loss for procedures to deal with an attack on Citadel Inquisitorius. It assumed that Prak City’s military functions would be a likelier target for sabotage, and that the Inquisitors, safe in their secluded mountain retreat, would be the ones moving to the city’s defense. Regardless, there is no point in staying on Prakith a minute longer, and heroes who choose to linger find the skies quickly filling, first with Imperial speeders and then with fighters attempting to prevent their escape. Gamemasters can turn this into an optional extended encounter, but after escaping the Citadel Inquisitorius, the heroes should be quite ready to hit the skies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VARIANT METHODS FOR CITADEL ESCAPE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since Jekk Seejo is not entirely reliable, the heroes might make alternative plans for their escape from the Citadel. However events progress, the characters have a very narrow window for getting out, and their plans should address that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Leaving a hero (instead of Jekk Seejo) in Prak City with the ship causes events to proceed more or less the same, only without the award for bringing Seejo into the resistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As another option, the heroes can try to bluff their way out of the Citadel. Considering that they probably caused a good deal of chaos while moving up through the tower, they might be able to descend in disguise if they also engage in a little sabotage along the way. If they manage to flee the Citadel, their best move is to retreat down the Stereb staircase, obtain the speeder bikes, and look for another exit farther into the cracked wilderness. Completely backtracking to the Stereb civilization, while possible, runs the risk of revealing the creatures’ existence to the Empire. The Citadel’s builders currently believe that whoever built the ruins around and under the Magraddor Range are long gone and have no connection with the Stereb found by the Geddis miners.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jumping to hyperspace puts some welcome distance between the heroes and Prakith, but their news about Master Denia’s fate is understandably troubling to their allies. Speaking holographically, Bail Organa reassures them that their efforts have not been in vain, and he asks them to return to Lady Alya Aldrete.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I know things look dark to you now, having lost Master Denia. But things have looked dark for the galaxy before, and good people have always come back—good people like Denia, who have helped us pour sand into the Imperial war machine and hopefully, some day, push back the darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“You have come a long way in the short time that I have known you. The end of the journey is in sight; the final steps lie ahead. I ask that you rendezvous with Lady Alya, who even now is working on leads to find Draco and put an end to the Sarlacc Project once and for all. Go, and may the Force be with you.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes meet back up with Lady Alya, they can begin Jaws of the Sarlacc, the final adventure of the Dawn of Defiance campaign.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WWW.GMBINDER.COM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This document was lovingly created using GM Binder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you would like to support the GM Binder developers, consider joining our Patreon community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GM Binder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Discover</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Log In</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Register</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Further Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terms of Service</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Us</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS: DAWN OF DEFIANCE EPISODE 10 - JAWS OF THE SARLACC</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jaws of the Sarlacc is the tenth and final adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, which should take heroes from 1st level through 20th level in a continuous storyline designed to give players and Gamemasters a complete SW5e experience. This adventure sends the heroes to the Deep Core world of Byss, where the Sarlacc Project—the construction of a massive Super Star Destroyer prototype—is underway. The heroes should advance to 20th level by the end of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will have a chance to finally confront and defeat the traitorous Admiral Varth and the vile dark Inquisitor, Valin Draco. Jaws of the Sarlacc is the finale of the story arc that makes up the Dawn of Defiance campaign. After completing the adventure, the heroes will have saved the galaxy from an Imperial superweapon and paved the way for other rebellious elements to strike back at the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IS DAWN OF DEFIANCE?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dawn of Defiance is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of Revenge of the Sith, the adventures in the Dawn of Defiance campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic SW5e experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The Dawn of Defiance campaign takes the heroes all the way from 1st level up to 20th level, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain two levels per adventure. Gamemasters should feel free to use the Dawn of Defiance adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the GM’s Primer, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Warning! If you will be playing in a Dawn of Defiance campaign or in a campaign utilizing its adventures, read no further.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ADVENTURE BACKGROUND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The entire Dawn of Defiance campaign has led up to this point. Having finally uncovered the truth about the Sarlacc Project and traveled to the Deep Core in pursuit of their ally, Jedi Master Denia, the heroes are poised to shut down the Empire's plans. Lady Alya Aldrete, an ally they made during a recent visit to Alderaan, has provided them with aid thus far. Now, she is ready to help them make their final push to stop the Empire from completing the construction of their first Super Star Destroyer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sadly, during their trip to Prakith in the ninth adventure, Sword of the Empire, the heroes suffered the loss of one of their staunchest allies, Master Denia. They are now truly their own masters, and others are looking to them as leaders of the fledgling rebellion. Lady Aldrete has summoned the heroes to rendezvous with her, and she will help fill them in on the plan to finally put an end to the Empire's Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ADVENTURE SUMMARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are summoned to a rendezvous in the Deep Core, where they meet with Lady Aldrete and discover that she has summoned her entire fleet of smugglers and criminals. Combined with the remnants of the battle group belonging to the Resurgence, these ships form a relatively impressive fleet, which Lady Aldrete and Bail Organa hope to use to stage a daring mission against the Sarlacc Project. After being briefed on the plan, the heroes set course for the planet Byss, the Emperor's secret throne world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once they arrive at Byss, the heroes must infiltrate a Golan Defense Platform and shut down its defense mechanisms. There, they confront Inquisitor Draco for the last time, only to discover that the traitorous Admiral Varth has taken command of the Super Star Destroyer. In a stunning move, he fires up the ship's engines and makes a short hyperspace jump to join the battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes, along with the pilots of Blue Squadron, must brave the battle between the defenders of Byss and Lady Aldrete's fleet, fly into the superstructure of Super Star Destroyer, and blow up its main reactor. That is the only way to destroy the vessel and save what's left of Lady Alya's fleet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OPENING CRAWL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STAR WARS : DAWN OF DEFIANCE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Episode X: Jaws of the Sarlacc</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The galaxy rests on a tipping point as the forces of evil have struck a devastating blow against the Alderaan Resistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yet all is not lost, and even now the Alderaanian noble Lady Alya Aldrete has summoned allies and great heroes to take part in a daring attack on the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the fate of the Resistance hangs in the balance, a small band of heroes has a chance to strike a blow that will echo through the ages, and show others that even the mighty Empire can be defeated . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 1: A BOLD PLAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After speaking with Bail Organa at the conclusion of the previous adventure, the heroes are directed to meet up with Lady Alya Aldrete. They find her at a rendezvous point in space, outside a massive gas cloud where she has amassed a small armada of ships. The rendezvous point is only two hours away via hyperspace, still well within the Deep Core Security Zone, and Lady Aldrete's communications officer transmits a hyperspace route for the heroes to follow that will get them there safely. As the heroes approach the rendezvous point, describe the other vessels here as a rag-tag collection of tramp freighters, modified bulk haulers, a few Clone Wars-era capital ships, and an overall motley assortment of vessels that look vastly different from the pristine ships of the Empire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Alya invites the heroes to dock on her flagship, a heavily modified Corellian gunship. As the deck crew sets to refueling and restocking their ship (or ships), the heroes are shown to temporary quarters and allowed to refresh themselves. Once suitably rested and cleaned up, they are invited to join Lady Aldrete in the ship's command bridge to discuss the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LADY ALDRETE'S BRIEFING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Aldrete welcomes the heroes into her ship's command bridge, where she and some other rough-looking ship captains are quietly talking next to a holographic display that looks positively chaotic from a distance. The heroes also spot two familiar faces—Captain Adrian Verana and Captain Sirona Okeefe, who seem to be deep in their own conversation. As the heroes approach, they realize that the display shows a single, massive planet around which hundreds, if not thousands, of ships and space stations can be seen in continuous orbit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes step up to the projector, Lady Aldrete ends her conversation and turns to them. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"My dear friends,\" says Lady Aldrete, a look of pity in her eyes. \"It is good to see you alive. Bail told me about Master Denia—she will be sorely missed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"I'm afraid that we have little time for mourning. Too many lives have already been sacrificed to stop now. While you were traveling to Prakith, I sent out the call for all of my contacts in the Deep Core to come to me, and one of them brought some very timely data. We have not only discovered the location of the Sarlacc Project above the planet Byss, but we have also obtained a full readout of the vessel's defenders, and we know that the Sarlacc Project, while not yet complete, is within weeks of being so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"What I have proposed to my captains is a mission to destroy the prototype. We've got enough ships to distract its defenders, but we can't hope to beat them and destroy the ship—just survive. What we need is someone to take control of their defenses and turn them against the prototype. You're our best, and probably only, hope for that.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With that, Lady Aldrete begins outlining what little they have of their plan. First, the smuggler fleet will jump into the Beshqek system and engage the Sarlacc Project's defenses. Then, while feigning a retreat, they will draw the defenders away from the Super Star Destroyer and its Golan Defense Platform. The heroes' strike team will then infiltrate the platform, seize control of its weapon complement, and turn the weapons on the Sarlacc Project. Undefended, it shouldn't take long for the Super Star Destroyer to become so much debris drifting into the atmosphere of Byss. The heroes and the smuggler fleet will then retreat and jump to lightspeed, leaving Byss far behind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of course, heroes being what they are, they might have some alternative plans they would like to enact. Lady Aldrete's plan is left somewhat vague intentionally, and if the players show some initiative, you should let them fill in the gaps or even rebuild the plan from the ground up. Of course, allowing them to do so will alter the way this adventure plays out, but given the fact that this is the climax of the Dawn of Defiance campaign, feel free to let the players concoct a better plan if they see fit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The two most important parts of the plan, and the two events around which this adventure is engineered, are taking control of the Golan Defense Platform and flying into the superstructure of the Super Star Destroyer to take out its main reactor. When the heroes are cooking up their plan, keep in mind that, in general, those two events need to happen, and they must take place in that order.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Naturally, this adventure cannot cover every eventuality or plan that the heroes might come up with, but the following information should help you determine whether they succeed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Sarlacc Project is a Super Star Destroyer that has not yet reached completion. Many of its systems are still offline, but (unknown to Lady Aldrete and the heroes) its engines, life support, and weapons are online.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Super Star Destroyer is defended by a Golan Defense Platform. However, something the heroes do not know is that the platform also acts as a stabilizer by using its incredibly powerful tractor beams. The upshot is that the platform anchors the Super Star Destroyer in place; as long as the tractor beams are active, it cannot move.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The smuggler fleet is ragged, but well defended and captained by some of the best in the galaxy. Given the fact that the defense forces around Byss are not quite up to what they will be by the time of the Rebel Alliance, the smuggler fleet can survive about 20 minutes of direct fire, plus another 20 minutes during the faux retreat. If starfighters take part in the conflict, the fleet can survive for another 10 minutes during both the initial assault and the retreat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Even when the main defense forces pursue the smuggler fleet, a small number (mostly starfighters and Skipray blastboats) will stay behind. However, good piloting might allow a ship to avoid notice by more than one patrol.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Lady Aldrete's smuggler fleet has a number of slicers that can alter a starship's IFF transponders and other transmitters to disguise a small number of ships as Imperial vessels. This won't stand up to closer visual inspection, but it should fool sensors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Admiral Varth is commanding the skeleton crew currently operating the Super Star Destroyer. When the smuggler fleet appears, he immediately suspects a trap and begins ordering the crew on the defense platform to begin emergency shutdown procedures of their tractor beams. However, due to the high power being pumped through the beams, shutting them down is a lengthy process—upward of 30 minutes if all protocols are observed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inquisitor Draco has retreated to Byss, where his time spent in dark meditation has revealed that he will face his final conflict with the heroes. With Admiral Varth's blessing, Draco has placed himself in charge of the defense platform, and he believes that once he defeats the heroes and crushes Alderaan's resistance, he will be given command of the Sarlacc Project and its associated fleet. He has not warned Varth of his visions. Instead, Draco plans to step in and save the day when Varth would have failed, thus removing the Admiral as a rival for control of the Emperor's greatest fleet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Golan platform is manned mostly by droids. Admiral Varth did not trust Humans to operate his prize ship's defenses, although he has allowed a complement of the Emperor's hand-picked agents to occupy the station for defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Varth will order the defense fleet to pursue the smugglers, hoping that they will be crushed by his ships. However, Admiral Varth is no fool, and he would not leave the Super Star Destroyer unprotected if it weren't defensible on its own. Varth believes (and rightly so) that the Super Star Destroyer, although incomplete, is still powerful enough to obliterate the smuggler's ships on its own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One way or another, a large chunk of the ship's hull will be ripped away, exposing the interior superstructure and providing access to the main reactor. Although this can happen in several ways (see Part 3 of the adventure), the heroes might come up with their own plan to gain access to the core.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GETTING TO THE GOLAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes have a plan, the mission can begin. Captains Okeefe and Verana are both taking part in the mission. Captain Verana will command Blue Squadron, a collection of starfighters cobbled together from the various smuggler crews, while Captain Okeefe will serve as Verana's wingman and executive officer. Lady Aldrete will lead her ship and the rest of the smuggler fleet into battle. The heroes have a chance to say their goodbyes, then it is time for leaving.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes depart, they make the short jump to hyperspace to the planet Byss. Upon arrival, they find everything going according to plan. The smuggler fleet is occupying the ships defending the Sarlacc Project, giving the heroes a clear shot at the Golan Defense Platform. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before your eyes hovers the oddly colored planet of Byss, its orange land masses and purple oceans casting the cockpit in an eerie glow. However, drawing your eyes away from the planet is the largest capital ship you have ever seen. The dagger-shaped hull of the Super Star Destroyer, known to you as the Sarlacc Project, looms large against the backdrop of the planet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Golan Defense Platform anchoring the massive ship looks tiny in comparison. All around, you see flashes of light as starships burst into flames and then flicker out, or watch the glowing light of turbolasers streaking between the vessels. The smuggler fleet has distracted the Sarlacc Project's defenders; now is the time to strike.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Luckily for the heroes, the plan is working, and only a few small patrols remain near the Super Star Destroyer. Unfortunately, being spotted by one is nearly unavoidable. A small patrol, consisting of a few elite TIE fighters, is on a course that will intersect with the heroes. If the heroes have taken precautions against being detected, play them out. Otherwise, the patrol spots the heroes' ship and attacks. This close to the Sarlacc Project, the patrols are ordered to fire on non-Imperial vessels without warning.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes can sneak by, deceive, or otherwise deflect the attention of the patrol, they should be able to avoid a violent conflict before docking with the Golan. Otherwise, the heroes must defeat the patrol before they can go on with their mission.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players engage with the TIE fighters, spawn up to 6 TIE L/Ns using the statblock from Chapter 1 except their proficiency bonus is +6 to represent their skills, modifying the stats as appropriate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: ABOARD THE GOLAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes have dealt with the patrol, they have the opportunity to land on the Golan Defense Platform. Assuming they have taken some steps to disguise their ship's sensor profile and IFF transponders, they can land in the docking bay without challenge thanks to the droid traffic controllers' lack of suspicion. If they took no such responses, the platform might open fire on the heroes' ship, but they can still blast their way into the docking bay in a matter of rounds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once inside, the heroes know they need to seize control of the defense platform to turn its weapons on the Super Star Destroyer. First, however, they must deal with the station's defenders. Their arrival has not gone completely unnoticed, and they will face a challenging series of encounters to reach the central reactor control chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the Gamemaster, you might find it tempting to turn the following series of encounters into little more than a linear group of challenges, offering the heroes no choice in the matter. The encounters described below are meant to be used in any order that you see fit (with one exception; see \"Security Corridor\" on page 7), although they do make some basic assumptions about the order in which most heroes will tackle them. As with the planning of the operation in Part 1, give the heroes a chance to come up with their own methods for reaching the reactor. Then, each time they reach a good point, drop in one of these encounters to challenge them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes progress toward the central reactor chamber, take into account the following basic information about the platform.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE STATION INTERIOR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Golan Defense Platform orbiting Byss is designed primarily to defend and anchor the Super Star Destroyer at the center of the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Command Bridge: The primary command bridge for the Golan platform has been shut down in favor of rerouting control to an auxiliary bridge, located near the central reactor core for the whole platform. If the heroes reach the primary command bridge, they find it abandoned.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Computers: The station's main computer system and is one of the most sophisticated computers currently used by the Empire, giving any check involving the main computer of the station are made at DC 30. However, since the Empire staffs the station with droids, the central computer isn't always used to its full potential. Checks using the computers in auxiliary areas, such as corridors and nonessential locations are made at DC 25 and can be used to gain access to the station's main computer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Docking Bays: The Golan platform has three main docking bays, one of which is used for ships other than starfighters. Each of the other two bays holds a squadron of 12 TIE L/N fighters, which the heroes might have encountered already. Docking Bay 616 is the shuttle docking bay and is the one through which the heroes likely enter and exit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Patrols: Standard security protocol for the Golan platform calls for two stormtrooper squads per patrol (using the trooper squad statblock), each commanded by an Imperial officer (using the senior officer statblock). The Imperial officers in these patrols carry code cylinders for auxiliary computer systems (but not the main computer system).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Security Control Rooms: Each level of the space platform has its own security control room. These control rooms remain in constant contact with the auxiliary command bridge. Each one has security control computers that count as an auxiliary system, is staffed by four Imperial officers (using the senior officer statblock), and has a stormtrooper squad (using the trooper squad statblock) defending the control room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sensors: The sensors in the station are extremely sophisticated. When properly focused, they can detect everything from the number of beings in a room to the current health of each one. However, such focus is typically unneeded, and the droids controlling many of the station's sensors rarely perform such a sweep. Slicing the station's sensors to make them ignore the heroes requires a DC 26 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, made from a security control room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DOCKING BAY 616</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The docking bay most likely used by the heroes to enter and leave the platform—Bay 616—is typically used by the Empire to rotate crewmembers on and off the platform via shuttlecraft. When Lady Aldrete's fleet arrived, most of the ships normally kept in this hangar (Skipray blastboats, command shuttles, and so on) either joined the fight or departed for the relative safety of the planet below. It is likely that only one ship (other than the heroes' vessel) occupies this hangar: a Republic Sienar Systems Star Courier used by Inquisitor Valin Draco.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes made a grand show of their entrance or took no precautions against being identified by the sensors, they find a welcoming party waiting for them. After the heroes deal with the encounter, they can start making their way deeper into the platform.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes were cautious and managed to sneak their ship onto the platform, they might instead find the docking bay empty. In this case, they can deal with the \"Docking Bay 616\" encounter later, when they are attempting to fight their way back to their vessel as the station crumbles around them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes deal with this encounter upon first arriving, the enemies approach from the interior of the docking bay, as though coming from deeper in the station. If the heroes deal with this encounter during their attempted departure, the enemies instead are waiting for them near their ship(s).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the encounter begins, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before you stand four more Imperial Guard Champions, likely fresh off their training on Byss.

These doors are sealed from the inside but can be cut through by a lightsaber, opened with a DC 26 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, or disabled with a DC 28 Intelligence (Technology) check and opened with a DC 18 Strength check. Opening the doors grants access to the main reactor chamber and the auxiliary command bridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE FINAL SHOWDOWN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes finally reach the auxiliary bridge, they find a familiar face awaiting them. Having seen visions of this encounter in the Force, Inquisitor Draco has allowed to the heroes to reach him, sure that his victory will end their aspirations for inspiring rebellion and earn him a spot near the top of the Empire. When the heroes first arrive at the auxiliary command bridge, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The auxiliary command bridge is lit by the eerie red light of the main reactor. Standing near the junction between the two chambers is a sinister form of the cybernetically enhanced Inquisitor Draco, an ignited red-bladed lightsaber humming in his hand. Imperial technicians seem to be working furiously at control panels throughout the chamber. A pair of black-robed Imperial Shadow Guards stand just behind the Inquisitor, flanking him, lightsaber pikes at the ready.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"You're too late, my friends, too late,\" sneers Draco. \"Had I known, when our paths crossed so long ago on Almas, that you would become such a thorn in the Empire's side, I would have had the planet razed from orbit. Yet I did not, and here we stand. If you throw down your weapons now, I guarantee you a quick and painless death. As you can see, I have been looking forward to this meeting for some time now.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A large display screen on one side of room flickers to life, revealing the stern face of Admiral Varth, decked out in his resplendent Imperial admiral's uniform. \"Draco, why aren't those tractor beams offline yet? We're losing valuable men out there.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco offers you a small smile and says, \"In a moment, Admiral, your ship will be free of the station, and I will have disposed of these traitors in plenty of time for you to crush their fleet.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Inquisitor Draco has ordered his men to power down the tractor beams connecting the defense platform to the Super Star Destroyer. The heroes have only moments to stop that from happening before the Super Star Destroyer is free to destroy the fleet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the encounter begins, Draco and the two Imperial Shadow Guards are at the forefront, with the stormtroopers taking up advantageous positions toward the rear. Five Imperial officers man the tractor beam control stations and continue to work throughout the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have approximately 10 rounds to bring the tractor beams back up to full strength. There are five stations at which the tractor beams are being deactivated; each station is manned by an Imperial officer. Once the beams are down fully, the Super Star Destroyer will be free to make the short microjump into the middle of the ongoing battle, where it will devastate the enemy fleet. To restore the tractor beams, a hero must use their Action. If done at each station, the tractor beams power back up to full strength, which will severely damage the Super Star Destroyer when it tries to jump.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes fail to restore the tractor beams, the outcome of the adventure is not strongly affected. Their failure merely alters the method by which the Super Star Destroyer is damaged enough for the heroes to fly inside of it in Part 3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid, lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 20 (Heavy Exoskeleton + Cybernetics)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 276 (29d8+145)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>22 (+6) 16 (+3) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 20 (+5) 24 (+7)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +13, Con +12, Wis +12, Cha +14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +13, Acrobatics +10, Intimidaion +14, Lore +14, Perception +12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances kinetic and energy damage from enhanced weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities lightning</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Immunities kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities charmed, frightened</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive perception 22</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 23 (50,000 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Legendary Resistance (3/day). If Valin Draco fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting. Valin Draco is an 18th-level forcecaster. Valin Draco’s forcecasting ability is Charisma (power save DC 22, +14 to hit with force attacks) and it has 87 force points. Valin Draco knows the following force powers:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At-will: affect mind, denounce, feedback, force push/pull, necrotic charge, saber reflect</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1st-level: force jump, improved feedback, sap vitality, wound</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2nd-level: darkness, drain vitality, force sight, force throw</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3rd-level: choke, force lightning, force scream, knight speed, sever force</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4th-level: drain life, force immunity, improved force camouflage, shroud of darkness</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5th-level: greater feedback, improved force scream, improved phase strike, telekinesis</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6th-level: crush, force chain lightning</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7th-level: force lightning cone, ruin</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8th-level: death field</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Resistance. Valin Draco has advantage on saving throws against force powers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pinpoint Power. When Valin Draco casts a power that allows it to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw, Valin Draco can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Quickened Power. When Valin Draco casts a power that has a casting time of 1 action, it can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cybernetic Enhancements. Valin Draco wears armor reinforced by cybernetic enhancements. Valin Draco is immune to damage from unenhanced sources, and has resistance to damage from enhanced weapons. If Valin Draco takes ion damage, this trait does not function until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regeneration. Valin Draco regains 25 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If Valin Draco takes ion damage this trait does not function until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Multiattack. Valin Draco makes four melee attacks, or casts a power and makes a melee attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Martial Lightsaber. Melee Weapon Attack: Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Valin Draco regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At-Will Power. Valin Draco casts an at-will power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Move. Valin Draco moves up to its speed without provoking attacks of oppurtunity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting (1 legendary action per power level). Valin Draco can cast a force power by spending a number of legendary actions equal to the power level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Deathblow (Costs 3 Actions). Valin Draco makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, Valin Draco deals maximum damage, and the target cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL SHADOW GUARD (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This warrior, wearing black armor reminiscent of that worn by the Royal Guard, carries a lightsaber pike tipped with a glowing red blade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>IMPERIAL SHADOW GUARD</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (human), lawful dark side</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 17 (powered battle armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 118 (15d8+45)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>19 (+4) 18 (+4) 12 (+1) 10 (0) 19 (+4) 11 (0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +8, Con +5, Wis +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +9, Perception +8, Insight +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 18</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Glactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 10 (5,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Devotion. The Imperial Shadow Guard has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting. The Imperial Shadow Guard's innate Force casting ability is Wisdom (force save DC 16, +8 to hit with force powers).

Once the station is damaged by turbolaser fire, the main reactor chamber becomes a much more dangerous place, and the heroes will need to flee quickly or face severe radiation hazards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GET TO THE HANGAR!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the encounter with Draco is complete, the heroes find themselves confronted with the grimacing visage of Admiral Varth, who has watched the progress of the fight from the safety of the Sarlacc Project's bridge. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Admiral Varth scowls at you through the video screen, the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer visible in the background behind him. \"Why couldn't you have been killed when Organa's fleet fell apart? At least you won't live to see me crush your new allies. This makes twice that I've had to wipe out your little insurrection; how many other deaths are on your hands?\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With that, the admiral turns and speaks to someone offscreen. \"I want all available turbolasers to target the anchoring platform and fire when ready. Helm, engage the microjump. Let's end this farcical rebellion.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The platform rocks under your feet as turbolaser bolts slam into the station. The video display cuts out abruptly, and the computer monitors show a chilling sight—the Super Star Destroyer has jumped to hyperspace, reappearing in the middle of the ongoing battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With that, the heroes find themselves in a dangerous position they likely never expected. The space platform has been critically damaged by the Sarlacc Project, but it hasn't quite been destroyed. The heroes have mere minutes to make their way to their ship before the defense platform disintegrates with them inside it. Already they can feel the station listing as it begins to fall into Byss' atmosphere. At this point, the heroes are running for their lives, but once they are free of the station, they will realize that there are bigger things at stake, such as the success and survival of their friends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: INTO THE SARLACC</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes are back outside the Golan Defense Platform, they receive some disturbing news from Lady Aldrete's ship. The Super Star Destroyer has appeared in the middle of the battle and is devastating the smuggler fleet. Unfortunately, the ship was able to make a precise microjump thanks to an interdiction vessel in the middle of the battle, which yanked the ship out of hyperspace and is also currently preventing the smugglers from making the jump to lightspeed and escaping. The smuggler fleet is being slaughtered by the overwhelming firepower of the Super Star Destroyer. Lady Aldrete has ordered the fleet into a defensive formation, and starfighters have been launched to attack the interdicting vessel, but the situation looks grim.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, depending on how the heroes did at the end of Part 2, there might be a chance for survival. If they succeeded at returning the platform's tractor beams to full power, they discover that a huge chunk of the Sarlacc Project's still-under-construction superstructure has been ripped free, exposing the interior of the ship to space. Lady Aldrete's tactical advisors have concocted a reckless plan to pull their starfighters back from the attack on the interdictor and redirect them toward the Super Star Destroyer. Those ships will fly into the ship's superstructure, cruise along the narrow access tunnels, and destroy the main reactor with a well-placed proton torpedo. It's a desperate plan, but the heroes have pulled off incredible missions before, and Lady Aldrete begs them to take command of the starfighter squadron. It is the only hope the fleet has for surviving the battle. Skip to \"Blue Squadron,\" below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes did not stop the tractor beams from powering down, the Super Star Destroyer is not ripped open as it tears free of the Golan platform. Instead, when the heroes arrive at the scene of the battle, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A familiar voice crackles over your communications system. \"Well, it would come to this, wouldn't it? Trapped by the Empire, with all of these loyal men and women crushed by its might.\" The voice of Lady Aldrete sounds ragged and weary, and there is a hint of fear behind it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"What we do now, we do for the good of the galaxy. Good luck, my friends. See to it that everyone knows that the Empire can be brought low—we merely failed today.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In your front viewport, you see the thrusters of Lady Aldrete's command ship fire, and the vessel quickly picks up speed. It makes a straight shot for the Super Star Destroyer, shuddering as turbolaser fire splashes against its weakening shields. At the moment of impact, when Lady Aldrete's ship slams into the side of the Sarlacc Project, there is a bright flash of light and a short burst of static over the comm. In seconds, the light from the explosion fades, and her ship is no more. Where the command ship collided with the larger vessel, a huge hole now exposes the interior of the Super Star Destroyer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hole opened in the Super Star Destroyer's hull allows the heroes to fly inside, just as in Lady Aldrete's plan described above. In this case, it is Captain Verana who proposes the plan to the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BLUE SQUADRON</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The remaining starfighters—11 ships in all--rally to the heroes' position and affirm that they are prepared to fly into the Sarlacc Project and take out the ship. Among the pilots are Captains Verana and Okeefe, both of whom have survived the battle thus far. Blue Squadron, as they have been dubbed, is at the heroes' disposal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the purposes of the final three encounters of the adventure, Blue Squadron is considered to be engaging in their own encounters when flying into the superstructure. Basically, the starfighters are flying alongside the heroes and keeping the path clear. However, if it looks like any of the heroes is in real danger of dying (at least before the final encounter), you can have a member of Blue Squadron help. Their entrance can be dramatic, such as chasing a TIE fighter that is disintegrating in flames, or it can be a surprise, such as when Han saves Luke above the first Death Star in A New Hope.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any of the heroes have developed a strong attachment to either Captain Verana or Captain Okeefe, this might be a good time to introduce dramatic tension by putting their lives in danger. While the death of either captain might be suitably dramatic and motivate the heroes to complete their mission, neither one has to die. At this point in the campaign, you'll know whether their deaths would serve the story or harm it, but one way or another, the heroes should have to face the reality that some of their most stalwart allies are in real danger.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FLYING THROUGH THE SUPERSTRUCTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes have rallied Blue Squadron around them, they must enter the ship's superstructure and destroy the main reactor inside. The three encounters below must be completed in the order presented. Because the heroes will be racing toward the center of the Super Star Destroyer as fast as possible, these three encounters could be considered to be one large encounter, but they are offered here separately to make the sequence easier to run.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INTO THE SHIP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First, the heroes must get inside the Super Star Destroyer. Unfortunately, a small group of TIE fighters is approaching to assist. Before the heroes can try to fly inside the ship, they must deal with the TIE fighters. Only then can they enter the superstructure at its weak point.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use a generic space battle map and place 6 TIE L/N Fighters (Stats can be found in Traitors Gambit) except their proficiency bonus is +6, adjusting stats accordingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE FASTEST PATH</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once inside the Super Star Destroyer, reaching the main reactor is no easy task. The tunnels within the superstructure (a necessity of design, making it possible to work on the vessel) do not simply connect point A to point B in a series of straight lines. Instead, the tunnels twist, turn, and curve. When beginning this encounter, reveal the paths available to the heroes only as they take them. This will reinforce the blindness they should experience while flying into the ship without knowing exactly where to go.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Streaking through the interior of the vessel, you see the superstructure fly by you on both sides. Laser fire continues to hound your movements, coming from TIE fighters as well as interior defense laser cannons. The twisting passageways ahead of you come up rapidly, giving you only seconds to react.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Place 4 TIE L/N Fighters once again (with their proficiency bonus being +6 as before) and have them chase the players. Their only goal is to destroy the players and will do everything in their power to do so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>MAIN REACTOR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The main reactor chamber is a large, cavernous area where the vacuum of space is used to diffuse the heat generated by the reactor. A deflector shield protects the reactor from the outside, so the heroes will have to use tertiary or secondary weapons to destroy the reactor. If the heroes do not have access to these, there is one alternative: sacrifice. A collision between a ship and the reactor, even a ship as small as a starfighter, is enough to destroy the reactor core and, by extension, the Super Star Destroyer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Suddenly, the narrow corridors within the superstructure open wide, revealing a cavernous chamber. At the center of this chamber sits the main reactor, shielded and waiting for you to destroy it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any TIE L/N Fighters that have not been destroyed continue to harass the players, attempting to prevent them from destroying the Super Star Destroyer. Feel free to add more if you feel the tension would be increased by it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After 10 full adventures, the Dawn of Defiance campaign finally draws to a close. What began with the heroes rescuing a supposed Imperial traitor on Felucia culminates in the destruction of the first prototype Super Star Destroyer, the deaths of a powerful Imperial Inquisitor and the traitorous Admiral Varth, and the Empire suffering its first great defeat at the hands of a resistance. If you've made it this far, congratulations! We hope that you and your players have enjoyed the experience. Below, you will find suggestions for wrapping up the campaign and, perhaps, the seeds of future campaigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LONG-TERM REPERCUSSIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At first, the heroes might feel as if their efforts have done little good in the grand scheme of things. After all, the Empire will simply rebuild the Super Star Destroyer years later, in the form of the Executor and similar vessels. However, the heroes' actions result in two major positive outcomes. First, other minor rebellions of the galaxy realize that it is possible to resist the Empire with success. In essence, the heroes have bloodied the nose of the Empire for the first time, and other fledgling rebellions (which will eventually grow into the Rebel Alliance) now see that their causes are neither futile nor doomed to failure. Second, after the Sarlacc Project is destroyed, the Empire holds off on rebuilding the massive ship until its control over the galaxy is more firmly established. This gives its foes many years to build up small space fleets that are able to flee from Star Destroyers and other, smaller ships. Thus, the heroes' victory provides much-needed breathing room for other rebellions to build up their space forces, which directly affects the existence of the Rebel Alliance's eventual Navy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any heroes who died during the Dawn of Defiance campaign are remembered as martyrs for the cause of resisting the Empire, regardless of whether that was their intent. Likewise, any major Gamemaster characters who sacrificed themselves are memorialized by future rebellions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Heroes who survive the campaign have achieved their destinies and lived to tell about it, a feat few people in the galaxy have managed. At this point, it's likely that your players have some idea of how they want their characters to continue. Take their wishes into account, and work with the players to determine the next step. Jedi heroes might be troublesome for campaigns looking to fit in perfectly with the Rebellion era, so it's probably a good idea for such heroes to effectively leave the civilized galaxy. For example, perhaps those heroes, now Jedi Masters, head into the Unknown Regions in search of allies to help them bring down the Empire, or they might vanish within the Deep Core while on an undercover mission to subvert the Emperor's schemes. Other heroes might show up again in future campaigns as Gamemaster characters, giving you a great way to let them become part of the larger universe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As for Bail Organa, after his involvement in the heroes' rise, he becomes an icon around which many rebellious elements rally. However, the Empire does not forget his role in these events, and his involvement is just one more mark against him that results in the eventual destruction of Alderaan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WHAT IF THEY FAIL?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite the adventure's assumptions that the heroes succeed in their tasks, the Empire might yet win the day. If the heroes fail to destroy the Sarlacc Project, they likely all die, bringing the campaign to an end. However, their failure can serve as the genesis of a future campaign, in which the Empire has a prototype Super Star Destroyer that it uses to terrorize the galaxy in secret. Admiral Varth isn't ready to reveal the ship's existence publicly—at least, not until the Emperor demands it—and in the meantime, a new generation of heroes hears rumors of a massive ship that leaves only debris in its wake. The new campaign can consist of chasing the Super Star Destroyer's trail across the galaxy and culminate when the heroes lay a trap for the vessel, luring Admiral Varth and his prize into a position from which the ship can be destroyed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WWW.GMBINDER.COM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This document was lovingly created using GM Binder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you would like to support the GM Binder developers, consider joining our Patreon community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GM Binder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Discover</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Log In</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Register</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Further Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terms of Service</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Us</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>    </p>","folder":"YpfKe3paT2yKvJAE","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"WKsslx22jXa5lJbA","name":"3-03 On the Heights","content":"<h2>On the Heights</h2>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>This <strong>encounter</strong> begins with the players starting on the topmost of the<strong> three landing platforms </strong>in the area. Two of the <strong>six</strong> <strong>Bespin security guards</strong> wait on the bottom platform by the <strong>turbolift,</strong> while the remaining <strong>four</strong> exit the <strong>turbolift</strong> on the <strong>third platform,</strong> behind the players. The <strong>security chief</strong> waits in the <strong>turbolift</strong> but will exit when <strong>combat</strong> begins, and the <strong>two hovering security droids</strong> begin the encounter landing on the outer rim of the <strong>uppermost platform.</strong></p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>Though it is unlikely that the players will fail to notice the <strong>security guards</strong> pouring out of the <strong>turbolift,</strong> allow the players to make <strong>DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) checks </strong>to notice the whine of the <strong>patrol droids’</strong> jump jets. When the encounter begins, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Three circular landing platforms connect to a large, central turbolift shaft on one of the upper open levels of Cloud City. Each platform is offset from the others, allowing someone standing on one platform to view the other two without obstruction. Each platform is ringed with lights, and on the uppermost platform, you hear a pneumatic hiss as the doors to the turbolift slide open, allowing members of Bespin’s security force to pour out onto the platform.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Bespin Security Guard</h4>\n<p>Known in <strong>Cloud City</strong> as the <strong>Wing Guard, Bespin’s</strong> security force consists mostly of disciplined security personnel that report directly to the Baron-Administrator of <strong>Cloud City.</strong> These particular members of the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> are part of an anti-spice smuggling unit that has worked diligently to keep harder criminals—such as narcotics dealers—from polluting <strong>Cloud City</strong> with their corruption. With the Baron- Administrator’s permission, the guards follow a take-no-prisoners approach to policing the city, and they do not hesitate to use lethal force against the players.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>These Humans wear the dark blue uniform of Bespin’s security force.

They usually work in pairs, though against particularly resilient foes, they will sometimes combine all of their fire against the same opponent.</p>\n<p>Each security guard is carrying <strong>200 credits</strong> for a total of <strong>1200 credits.</strong></p>\n<h4>Bespin Security Chief</h4>\n<p>The <strong>security chief</strong> is the leader of the anti-spice smuggling squad. Drawn from the best private security forces in the galaxy, all <strong>Wing Guard</strong> <strong>security chiefs</strong> are guaranteed to make their squads better, more accurate, and more perceptive.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This member of Bespin’s Wing Guard boasts rank insignia far more impressive than that of the other members of the security team. Brimming with confidence, he issues orders with precision and poise.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>@Actor[StYLWYxTIOQBv4jg]{Bespin Security Chief}</strong></p>\n<h4>Bespin Security Chief Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>security chief</strong> has received special training and works best in concert with other members of the <strong>Wing Guard.</strong> On the <strong>first round</strong> of combat, he endeavours to keep as many of the <strong>security guards</strong> within range of his <strong>Aura of Command</strong> ability. From that point on, he seeks shelter behind the crates on the landing pad. If he sees that the fight is going against his men, he summons the two <strong>security guards</strong> from the lowest level (they call the <strong>turbolift</strong> on <strong>one round</strong> and ride it up the next), and then locks down the <strong>turbolift</strong> so that no one else can access it.</p>\n<p>He is carrying <strong>500 credits.</strong></p>\n<h4>Cloud City Patrol Droid</h4>\n<p>These droid security assistants are left over from the Clone Wars and have been modified to aid the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> in <strong>Cloud City.</strong> The droids boast jump jets that allow them to fly up to the highest platforms, though they can maintain this flight for only a <strong>round </strong>at a time. These <strong>patrol droids</strong> are designed to close to <strong>melee range</strong> with opponents and subdue them physically, though they are also equipped with <strong>ranged weapons</strong> if needed.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This tall battle droid resembles a skeletal humanoid with a smooth, featureless faceplate broken up by a pair of illuminated eyes.

They prefer to fight in <strong>melee</strong> with their <em>vibropikes</em> because their high <strong>Strength</strong> makes their <strong>attacks</strong> particularly devastating. If they see that the players are gaining an advantage, they will try to <strong>shove</strong> their foes off the platform, though they usually try to <strong>shove</strong> the players onto the platform below so they don’t die from the fall. The droids will use their jump jets to move between the three platforms safely, hoping to harass the players.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Given the odd hour at which this encounter takes place, there should be few bystanders to witness the fight. If the players manage to subdue or kill all of the <strong>Wing Guard,</strong> they may face repercussions later if it is discovered that they were responsible. However, given the need for the players to move about the city unhindered during the <strong>sabacc tournament,</strong> you should be careful about branding them as known criminals—at least until the tournament is over and the players find themselves on the wrong side of Imperial (and <strong>Bespin)</strong> law.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p>The three landing platforms overlap slightly, allowing flying players (particularly those with jet packs), players with some kind of rope, or simply reckless players to move between the platforms.

/></p>\n<p><strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, the adventures in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic <em>Star Wars Roleplaying Game</em> experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign takes the heroes all the way from <strong>1st level</strong> up to <strong>20th level</strong>, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain <strong>two levels per adventure</strong>. Gamemasters should feel free to use the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the @JournalEntry[I2Pv3itNmHDdrmPN]{GM's Primer}, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>","folder":"iGDc7lp2jckSGg1g","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"XMDxAd30slZJU3UP","name":"3-08 Skirmish Over Bespin<<>>","content":"<h2>Skirmish Over Bespin</h2>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>The setup for this <strong>encounter</strong> is particularly important because, in order for the scene to have any tension, you must strike a precise balance between the <strong>speed</strong> of the <strong>players’ ships</strong> and the <strong>speed</strong> of the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler.</strong> The <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon </strong></em>should be placed on the far side of the map. The <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> starts the <strong>combat</strong> <strong>1,500 feet</strong> or <strong>30 squares away</strong> from the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>, and will be moving directly toward it throughout the <strong>encounter.</strong> The players enter the battlefield <strong>1,200 feet behind</strong> the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> on the far side from the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>, so that the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> is in the middle. The<strong> TIE fighters</strong> start <strong>600 feet</strong> away from the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> placed between the <strong>hauler</strong> and the <strong>players.</strong></p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the <strong>encounter</strong> begins, allow the players to make a<strong> DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A successful <strong>check </strong>allows the players to discover the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> should reach the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> slave ship in <strong>5 rounds</strong>. When the encounter begins, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>The Gallofree Medium Transport identified as the Shackles of Nizon floats in space, illuminated by the light from Bespin below. A massive Tibanna gas hauling starship, laden with the explosive substance, barrels through space directly toward the slave ship. However, between you and the Tibanna gas hauler is nearly an entire squadron of the Empire’s TIE fighters. Ten of the flat-winged vessels scream toward you, lasers flashing even at a great distance.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>12th Squadron TIE Fighter</h4>\n<p>The <strong>12th Squadron</strong> is one of the first fighter squadrons to switch over from the now-antiquated V-wing starfighters to the cutting-edge <strong>TIE fighter</strong>. Though many of the pilots preferred the durability of the V-wing, the Empire’s mandate that all squadrons convert over to<strong> TIE fighters</strong> has been obeyed. Unfortunately, many of the pilots are not yet accustomed to the <strong>TIE fighter’s</strong> cockpit and maneuvering style. As a result, though the pilots might be considered skilled in the V-wings they trained in, they are reduced to mere competence in the cockpit of a <strong>TIE fighter</strong>. The <strong>12th Squadron</strong> is one of the first fighter groups to convert over entirely, and they have been assigned to the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> at the request of <strong>Valin Draco.</strong></p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:34.2857px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34.2857px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:34.2857px\"><em>Two large, flat wings flank the eyeball-like cockpit of this TIE fighter, which seems unblemished and without normal wear and tear, as though it just rolled off the assembly line.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>8 @Actor[i659SGD9QinsseAm]{TIE/LN Starfighter}</strong></p>\n<h4>TIE/LN Fighter Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>TIE fighters</strong> launched by the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> were dispatched to ensure that the players could not interfere with the destruction of the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> and the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> two starships that provide major evidence of the Empire’s dealings with <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. The <strong>TIE fighters’</strong> primary goal is to delay the players long enough for the <strong>Tibanna</strong> gas hauler to reach the<em><strong> Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>, though if they manage to kill some of the players in the process, they would consider it a victory. As such, they make extensive use of the <strong>Interfere action,</strong> hoping to slow the players by providing <strong>disadvantage</strong> to their <strong>attacks</strong> to destroy the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler.</strong> If the players manage to destroy the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> the <strong>TIE fighters</strong> receive new orders to destroy the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> themselves. As a result, the players will need to destroy all of the <strong>TIE fighters</strong> before the slave ship is destroyed.</p>\n<h4>Tibanna Gas Hauler</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> is a custom vehicle designed by the Ubrikkian corporation specifically for the transportation of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> from <strong>Cloud City.</strong> The starship operates via a <strong>droid brain</strong> that receives orders from designated controllers; unlike a slave circuit, the <strong>droid brain</strong> on the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> can make snap decisions on its own to preserve the ship. In this instance, the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> has been ordered to collide with the <strong>Shackles of Nizon,</strong> and the single-minded <strong>droid brain</strong> controlling it will stop at nothing to complete the mission.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:34.2857px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34.2857px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:34.2857px\"><em>This long, tubular starship resembles a shiny metal cylinder with engines at one end and a cockpit on the other. Auxiliary metal canisters, some as large as a starfighter, decorate the hull of the ship at odd intervals, acting as secondary storage areas for the Tibanna gas inside. Blinking red and green lights line either side of the space transport, flashing at regular intervals like the warning lights on industrial vehicles.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Tibanna Gas Hauler&gt;&gt;</strong></p>\n<h4>Tibanna Gas Hauler Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> will stop at nothing to complete its sole mission: to collide with the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizo</strong><strong>n</strong></em>. The volatile <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> in its storage area is guaranteed to create a much larger explosion than normal, so the vessel travels along a straight course for the <strong>Medium Transport,</strong> heedless of its own safety even if under fire.</p>\n<h4>Shackles of Nizon</h4>\n<p>This <strong>Medium Transport</strong> has traveled from the <strong>Byss</strong> system, where the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> is being worked on, and has weathered a good deal of <strong>damage</strong> before arriving at <strong>Bespin.</strong> Thousands of mistreated and malnourished slaves are inside the ship’s holds, and it is controlled by a slave circuit installed by the Empire.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:34.2857px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34.2857px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:34.2857px\"><em>This Medium Transport looks like all of the other ships in the line produced by Gallofree Yards, though it has seen better days. Large amounts of carbon scoring dot the vessel’s exterior, and wide segments of the ship’s hull seem to have been replaced haphazardly.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>&lt;&lt;\"Shackles of Nizon\"&gt;&gt;</strong></p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>With the <strong>TIE fighters</strong> destroyed and the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> stopped, the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> is safe from destruction. The ship refuses all hails; however, the slaves became aware of the battle outside (and of the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> careening toward them), disabled the slave circuit, and regained control of the ship just as the <strong>encounter</strong> concludes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p>There are no environmental hazards to deal with in this encounter. However, you can use <strong>Inquisitor Draco’s</strong> Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, the <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> as another element of the environment. Have the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> choose a point within range, barraging a 150-foot area with its Heavy Laster Battery.

The three <strong>Quarren</strong> work for <strong>Darga</strong>, but the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> and the Wookiee came to the <strong>palace</strong> as part of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> delegation.</p>\n<p>When combat begins, the <strong>assassins</strong> have moved into the guest quarters and have access to the heroes’ rooms. Each of the <strong>Quarren</strong> moves into a different guest room (if the heroes are grouped into one or two rooms, some of the Quarren will move into the same room) to try to kill the heroes in their sleep. The <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> stands guard at one end of the guest quarters hallway in case a hero tries to escape, while the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> poisoner hides in the common area, waiting to strike at anyone who emerges from a room.</p>\n<p>Remember that if the heroes previously caught the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> trying to <strong>poison</strong> <strong>Darga’s drink</strong> and exposed her, she<strong> does not take part</strong> in this encounter.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>Read the following text aloud to the heroes:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Late in the evening, the guest quarters of Darga’s palace are quiet and peaceful.

Any heroes who fail the <strong>check </strong>are surprised and do not act during the <strong>surprise round</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Quarren Assassin</h4>\n<p><strong>Darga the Hutt </strong>employs a trio of <strong>Quarren assassins</strong> who also double as bounty hunters, tracking down the crime lord’s enemies or agents that fail to do his bidding. These <strong>assassins</strong> are paid well, and though they are of relatively low level, they have been trained to attack quickly and precisely.

Skilled with a variety of poisons, she is the <strong>slavers’</strong> clandestine way of dealing with enemies. <strong>Igren Demos</strong> knows this, but he does not tell his master.

Part of the muscle of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> delegation, the <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> is a big, brutish warrior who fought as a mercenary for the Separatists in the Clone Wars.

In truth, the <strong>Quarren assassins</strong> believe the order was handed down from <strong>Darga</strong> (though the <strong>Hutt</strong> has no knowledge of the assassination attempt), and the <strong>Twi’lek poisoner</strong> and the <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> know only that their Zabrak leader ordered them to assist. If <strong>Darga </strong>is confronted, he tells the heroes plainly that he had nothing to do with it, and if the heroes investigate further, they find the servant who delivered “<strong>Darga’s</strong>” order to the Quarren dead in his quarters—killed by<strong> Igren</strong> <strong>Demos </strong>to keep him silent. The <strong>Zabrak slaver</strong> similarly claims that the servant brought him the order to have his comrades join in the assassination attempt. If <strong>Darga </strong>finds out about the <strong>slavers’</strong> involvement, he expels them from his <strong>palace</strong> immediately, warning the <strong>Zabrak</strong> to keep his minions on a tighter leash for their next visit.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/a_knife_in_the_dark.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"819\" /></p>","folder":"tGyRjO9FvMNYmhSK","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

He expected to be freed by <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> staff, not by hired freelancers. However, he is willing to accept whatever stories the heroes tell him as long as they promise to get him out of the facility. <strong>Varth </strong>is eager to take the ruse to the next stage and pass on so-called vital secrets that will lure <strong>Organa </strong>and his agents into a trap.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is fairly guarded about the specifics of his imprisonment. Unsure of who the heroes are, he doesn’t want to reveal too much, but he confirms that he is a former Imperial Admiral who has been funneling information to “<em><strong>interested third parties</strong></em>” for some time now. He says that he was captured a short while ago and is being held at the Felucian <strong>prison facility </strong>until the proper Imperial authorities can arrive to retrieve him.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth </strong>agrees to help the heroes escape from the facility, but he’s not terribly interested in helping them fight. He can give them advice, but he is reluctant to pick up a blaster, even in his own defense.

However, two developments threaten their plans. First, they come upon a disturbing sight—just outside the grate, a large number of <strong>@Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{stormtroopers} </strong>stand around the crumpled body of their <strong>Felucian guide</strong>, and an <strong>@Actor[LLxezY3EqvHI9H7r]{AT-ST}</strong> stomps around the exterior of the facility. Second, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> sends a message over the heroes’ comlinks — the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is operational again, and they can leave the planet whenever they are ready. If the heroes don’t remember the second floor of the facility (which they should have seen from the outside), <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> mentions that some of the Imperials he dealt with mentioned the presence of a command center on the second floor. He suggests that they make their way up there and attempt to reach the roof. From there, they can call <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> for a pickup and avoid the Imperial presence outside.</p>","folder":"4iBdkSX2x86riePC","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

If you give a PC deployment ranks, their overall rank actually goes up, and I think that's the number the starship sheet reads to determine if it takes the character's prof bonus.</p>\n<p>However I've reported this bug and I think it's VERY likely it will be fixed before we release, so I say we build everything assuming it will work right and make a few specific \"Deployment PC versions\" of characters at the very end, just in case we need them to make ships work.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7C4n5U6t3s1t1j3A":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"g0de7VUU1BnwfOCV","name":"Part 2: The Tournament","content":"<h1>Part 2: The Tournament</h1>\n<p>By the time the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> begins, the players should have had time to relax in their suite in the <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> for a <strong>day </strong>or <strong>two. Captain Okeefe</strong> remains on board the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> with her droid copilot, occasionally checking in to make sure nothing has gone awry. The players know by now that <strong>Darga </strong>is deep in hiding, and that the Empire is sending a representative to the <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> to make another transaction with the <strong>Hutt</strong> (or one of his agents). The players should have been watching for a communiqué from the Empire (intended for <strong>Baron Kithriss)</strong> that will, with luck, provide them with more information about what will happen at the <strong>sabacc tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players have attempted to find out more about the tournament, they discover with no real issues the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> is held annually, and it is one of the most highly publicized sabacc tournaments in the galaxy.</li>\n<li>This year, the tournament is being held at the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> though past tournaments have been held in other casinos and even at the <strong>Yerith Bespin hotel.</strong></li>\n<li>The buy-in for the <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> is <strong>10,000 credits per person</strong>, with the winner taking the entire prize at the end of the tournament.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Arrival of the Empire</h2>\n<p>Once you feel that the players have had enough time to recuperate from their previous encounters, their involvement in the <strong>Cloud City</strong> <strong>Sabacc Tournament </strong>can begin. As expected, a message comes over the city’s communications system directly to the console in their hotel room. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p>Missive from Coruscant: Transaction codename SARLACC065824 set to occur during Cloud City Sabacc Tournament as planned. The Hutt has assured us that his agent will be present to receive the handoff. An officer from the <em>Assiduous</em> will be taking part in the tournament. The transaction will occur during play so as to avoid arousing suspicion. You are responsible only for observing this transaction and making sure that the Hutt’s agent does nothing to endanger the secrecy of the arrangement. Under no circumstances are you to interfere with the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, send a confirmation message to Coruscant standard relay 88-ShenXesh-3, then return to Chandrila. No further instructions will follow.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With the message received, the players now know what to look for. If they can discover which of the <strong>sabacc players</strong> is <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>agent</strong>, and if they can observe the details of the transaction, they can likely find out where the <strong>Hutt</strong> is hiding and perhaps discover the depth of his involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The fact that the Empire refers to the transaction by the <strong>Sarlacc</strong> codename should indicate to the players that they are on the right track.</p>\n<p>If the players are still having trouble deciding what to do, don’t be afraid to remind them that their mission is to discover the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> Knowing that a payment from the Empire is going to take place during the <strong>tournament</strong> gives them a chance to dig deeper into the façade surrounding the project. From this point on, the players know that they need to be present at the <strong>tournament</strong> to learn more about the dealings between the <strong>Hutt</strong> and the Empire. Several ways that they can become involved in the <strong>tournament</strong> are described below. Note that not all of the players need to follow the same path; some might act as bystanders, others might work security, and another player might participate in the tournament. Since all of the events surrounding the tournament take place roughly in the same locale, you need not worry about splitting the party up. They all will be present for most scenes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee I</strong></p>\n<p>At some point during the players’ quest to find their particular niche in the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament, Captain Okeefe</strong> contacts them via comlink to relay a short message. According to <strong>Okeefe,</strong> her droid copilot was able to tap into the city’s central computer to keep an eye on all communications and sensor data flowing through spaceport control. Moments ago, an Imperial I class Star Destroyer whose transponder identified it as the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> dropped out of hyperspace on the edge of the system, escorting a Gallofree Yards Medium Transport (callsign Shackles of Nizon ). The Star Destroyer launched a single Theta -class shuttle, which set a course for <strong>Bespin.</strong> The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> promptly jumped to lightspeed, leaving the Medium Transport behind. Though <strong>Okeefe</strong> doesn’t think that a single shuttle will bring much trouble, she warns the players to be on the lookout for an Imperial presence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Entering the Tournament</h2>\n<p>One of the clearest means of getting a front-row seat for the <strong>tournament</strong> action is to enter the game as a competitor. If the players have <strong>10,000 credits</strong> they are willing to part with, they can buy a seat for their best gambler at one of the tables. If they have achieved greater wealth, they can get more than one player into the game. Each buy-in of <strong>10,000 credits</strong> is enough to get one player into the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>A player entering the <strong>tournament</strong> is interviewed briefly by one of the pit bosses of the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> before being given instructions on when to arrive, where to go, and so forth. The gamblers are not allowed to leave the table except during designated breaks, and each gambler is subject to a thorough search each time he enters or exits the gambling hall. These searches are to prevent cheating and ensure that no one is trying to smuggle <strong>sabacc</strong> <strong>cards</strong> in or out. Lastly, each gambler is required to wear a small pin to show that he is still active in the <strong>tournament;</strong> removing the pin while in the casino will result in immediate expulsion from the game.</p>\n<p>Any players who succeed on a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check </strong>can tell that the pin is more than decorative. In truth, each pin is a <em>communications-jamming device.</em> The wearer of a pin cannot use <em>commlinks—</em>they produce only static. An anti-cheating device, the pin prevents gamblers from receiving outside help during the tournament.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Buying Back In</strong></p>\n<p>If one of the players playing in the tournament is eliminated, you have the option of allowing the player to reenter the game. At some point during the <strong>round</strong>, one of the other gamblers suffers a severe reaction to a drink, requiring immediate medical attention. With that gambler eliminated, the tournament administrator allows one of the previously defeated players to step back into the game for a new buy-in of <strong>2,000 credits,</strong> allowing him or her to compete in the hospitalized gambler’s place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>If the players do a bit of asking around, they find out quickly that <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot,</strong> owner of the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> has been hiring a private security force to help keep things safe at his casino during the <strong>tournament.</strong> With a little diligence, any interested players can set up an interview with <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> about joining his security force. <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> is a large, boisterous man in his late 40s who has owned the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> for decades, and though he is a shrewd businessman, he is friendly and excited to see capable beings taking an interest in the security of the <strong>tournament.</strong> After a few cursory questions about the players (where they are from, what brings them to <strong>Cloud City,</strong> whether they have any outstanding warrants, and so on), <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> makes them an offer: provide security for all <strong>four days</strong> of the tournament at a rate of<strong> 500 credits</strong> <strong>per day</strong>. During that time, <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> will arrange special permits for the players that allow them to carry their normal weapons, ignoring <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> usual restrictions. If the players accept his offer, <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> gives them their weapons permits immediately and tells them when to arrive and where to go.</p>\n<p>During the <strong>tournament,</strong> the players working security will guard the doors, helping to ensure that no one gets in with an illegal weapon. If they wish to turn a blind eye to their comrades smuggling in weapons, no one will question their searching methods. This is a good way for the players to get some weapons into the tournament; they will come in handy later, when the shooting starts.</p>\n<h2>The Crowd</h2>\n<p>Few spectators are allowed into the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> during the <strong>tournament.</strong> Each competitor is allowed to bring in one guest to observe, but unless the rest of the players have taken jobs with the security team, they need another way to get in. Players may be able to use a <strong>Charisma (Deception)check </strong>at <strong>DC 14</strong> to bluff their way as it shouldn’t be too hard to pose as an important <strong>Cloud City</strong> official or convince the guards that the player is a relative of one of the other competitors.</p>\n<p>Members of the crowd must stand back from the main gambling floor during the <strong>tournament,</strong> but during breaks in the action, they can visit with the competitors, allowing the players to collaborate during the <strong>tournament.</strong> If any player posing as a spectator spends a little too much time socializing with their fellow players on the security team, it might arouse the suspicion of <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot.</strong> Though <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> might not say anything to the players, he orders other members of his security force to keep an eye on the players who recently joined the team. <strong>Mandelbrot’s</strong> warning grants NPC members of the security team <strong>advantage</strong> on <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> made against those players.</p>\n<h2>Dirty Money</h2>\n<p>If the players are still having trouble finding a good place to be during the <strong>tournament,</strong> they have one more option. Just before the start of the <strong>tournament,</strong> <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> receives a message from <strong>Switch</strong> (the droid crime lord encountered in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>), asking the players to contact him and providing a means of doing so using the city’s communications system. Some of <strong>Switch’s</strong> contacts on <strong>Cloud City</strong> mentioned seeing the players, and considering that they have worked well with the droid in the past, <strong>Switch</strong> thought they might be amenable to working for him during the <strong>sabacc tournament.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Switch</strong> always has an interest in illicit activities throughout the galaxy, and with the amount of <strong>credits</strong> flowing through <strong>Cloud City</strong> during the tournament, the droid wants a piece of the action. <strong>Switch</strong> proposes to have the players influence the outcome of the <strong>tournament,</strong> enabling a victor of <strong>Switch’s</strong> choosing to take the pot. The droid has already supplied the <strong>tournament</strong> entry fee to one of his contacts (the Twi’lek starship <strong>captain Koroma Moro</strong>) but he wants the players to ensure that <strong>Moro</strong> is the victor in the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players assure him that they will help, <strong>Switch</strong> offers them a percentage of the winnings <strong>(5%</strong> of the total pot, though he is willing to increase the percentage to <strong>7%</strong> if the players bargain successfully). <strong>Switch</strong> is not concerned about the players failing to live up to their end of the bargain. He knows that it is in their interest to help <strong>Koroma</strong> <strong>Moro</strong> win, because if he loses, they get nothing.</p>\n<h2>Rogues' Gallery</h2>\n<p>You may wish to keep a list of generic NPCs to flesh out the <strong>tournament’s</strong> competitors. Most of these NPCs can simply be names with a species and a personality attached, because their statistics will not matter for the challenges in this adventure. However, <strong>five gamblers</strong> should be of particular interest to the players. Over the course of the <strong>tournament,</strong> these competitors should stand out as exceptional players and beings of interest. Any one of them could be <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>, though one—<strong>Koroma Moro</strong>—is a bit less suspect because he is known to be in <strong>Switch’s</strong> employ. Before the tournament ends, the players should have gathered enough information to narrow down the possibilities a bit.</p>\n<h3>Creeska</h3>\n<p><strong>Creeska</strong> is a Rodian gambler who has made a name for himself as an exceptionally aggressive competitor. Though he is friendly—and surprisingly likable, for a Rodian—he never wants to back down from a bluff and has used his gambling muscle to intimidate his opponents into making mistakes. <strong>Creeska</strong> wears a bulky jacket made of Krayt dragon leather (or so he claims; in truth, it is merely dewback hide) and is quite generous in sharing his winnings with others in the casino. <strong>Creeska</strong> is also a cheater and should provide a chance for players working as <strong>security guards</strong> to catch him cheating on the <strong>final day </strong>of the tournament.</p>\n<h3>Silas Draver</h3>\n<p>Cool, suave, and sophisticated, <strong>Silas Draver</strong> is the perfect image of the Human gambler. With long black hair pulled back in a ponytail and a mustache that droops down both sides of his mouth, <strong>Silas</strong> always wears a confident smirk, and he always speaks as though he knows something that the person he’s talking to does not. <strong>Draver</strong> is a savvy gambler who plays it close to his chest; he is also a <strong>con artist</strong> who has managed to get several of his cronies into the list of approved spectators. If he loses, he is planning on<strong> stealing the pot</strong>, and he has sabotaged <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>sabacc dealer droids</strong> to help further that scheme. He has also paid a <strong>security guard</strong> handsomely (and offered a percentage of the prize to him as well) to overlook the <strong>weapons</strong> carried by <strong>Draver</strong> and his <strong>cronies.</strong></p>\n<h3>Lady Mirana Fioro</h3>\n<p>Looking somewhat out of place among the gamblers and card sharks, <strong>Lady Mirana Fioro</strong> is a Hapan woman who looks as though she just stepped out of a royal court. In truth, however, she is merely a <strong>con artist</strong> who specializes in running scams while impersonating a Hapan noble. The word that best describes her attitude is “<strong>frosty</strong>”—she barely has a second word for anyone, and she rebuffs any advances. <strong>Mirana Fioro</strong> is also <strong>Darga the Hutt’s agent</strong>, and her sole purpose in entering the <strong>tournament</strong> is to receive the payment from the Imperial officer and obtain the information that <strong>Darga</strong> needs to take control of the Medium Transport delivered by the Empire.</p>\n<h3>Koroma Moro</h3>\n<p><strong>Koroma Moro</strong> is a starship captain who also happens to be an exceptional gambler. He has hauled cargo for <strong>Switch</strong> in the past, and when <strong>Switch</strong> offered to front his entry fee, the Twi’lek knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up. <strong>Koroma</strong> <strong>Moro</strong> is a polite but secretive man who has had a number of unfortunate incidents with the authorities since the Empire came to power. As such, he is always cautious when approached by new people, but if any of the players mention <strong>Switch,</strong> <strong>Moro</strong> lets his guard down a bit, though he is still unwilling to discuss the details of his relationship with the droid crime lord.</p>\n<h3>Vorn Zaday</h3>\n<p>A quiet Neimoidian woman, <strong>Vorn Zaday</strong> is a skilled <strong>sabacc player</strong> who is almost completely unknown to others on the tournament circuit. <strong>Vorn</strong> was a minor dignitary in the Trade Federation who became quite skilled at the game while playing with the officers aboard a Separatist starship during the Clone Wars. She now lives on <strong>Cato Neimoidia,</strong> but she has no connection to<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>. Her presence in the tournament is just a coincidence, but it might be enough to throw the players off of <strong>Mirana Fioro’s</strong> trail.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[S4IY5yMBek0ltyeX]{Rogues' Gallery}</p>\n<h2>Days 1 to 2: Elimination Rounds</h2>\n<p>The <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> begins with one of the largest opening ceremonies that <strong>Cloud City</strong> has ever seen. More than <strong>51 competitors</strong> have entered the <strong>tournament</strong> (plus any players who entered), and the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> is packed with players and spectators. When the day begins, read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The first day of the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament opens with hundreds of sentient beings packed into the Royal Casino. Members of many species dot the predominantly Human audience, and the sounds of droids dealing sabacc cards rise over the din. The clank of glasses and hum of conversation fills the air, but at each of the sabacc tables, there is mostly silence except for the occasional words of a gambler placing his bets. Servant droids wheel about in the crowd, and members of the Royal’s security force keep a watchful eye over the proceedings.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Each <strong>sabacc table</strong> has only <strong>five</strong> or<strong> six players</strong> at any time, though as the<strong> first two days</strong> wear on,<strong> all but two players</strong> from each of the <strong>10 tables </strong>will lose out of the game. Over the course of the<strong> </strong>first days of the tournament, players fulfilling many different roles will have a chance to interact with the events surrounding the <strong>tournament.</strong> Below, you will find entries for each of the suggested roles for players involved in the <strong>tournament.</strong> If the players chose to involve themselves in some other way, feel free to adapt these scenarios to interact with the players. Not only do these scenarios provide something for the players to do each day, but they also provide hints as to who is working for <strong>Darga </strong>and who is not.</p>\n<h3>Tournament Competitors</h3>\n<p>On either the <strong>first</strong> or <strong>second day,</strong> one player participating in the tournament has a chance to interact with the officer from the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em>. The two are paired up at one of the <strong>sabacc tables,</strong> and as the day wears on, the player should have a chance to talk to the officer, who names himself <strong>Lt. Armen Arandis. Lt. Arandis</strong> wears his Imperial uniform during the tournament, and each day it looks crisp, clean, and neatly pressed. He is young, perhaps not long out of the Imperial Academy, and his cool gaze is disrupted only by a long scar that cuts diagonally across his face, starting at one temple, crossing his right eye, and ending at his upper lip. <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is the picture of Imperial discipline, and he is also an excellent gambler. He begins with an unfriendly attitude toward anyone else in the tournament. He is not comfortable being in an environment that has not accepted Imperial rule, and from his point of view, every patron of the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> could very well be a dangerous criminal.</p>\n<p>If the player sitting at his table can manage to shift his attitude to at least indifferent, <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> will talk cordially to the player while they play <strong>sabacc.</strong> Though he is not forthcoming with information, there are a few things he will share, but only if asked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is an Imperial officer doing playing in the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament?</strong> “<em>Sabacc is a game of skill, but also one of luck. Much as in battle, best-laid plans can go awry due to random elements. Unfortunately, my fellow shipmates have ceased to be a challenge for me, so I requested leave to come play in the tournament in hopes of seeing how I fare against the rest of the galaxy.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How long have you been playing sabacc? </strong>“<em>I just learned the game a little over a year ago, in the Academy. My Tactics instructor used sabacc analogies frequently to illustrate his points, so I sought out the game</em>.”</li>\n<li><strong>What do you think of the competition?</strong> “<em>Not Much.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>What ship are you posted on? </strong>“<em>I am a tactical officer aboard the Imperial I -class Star Destroyer the Assiduous . We are on special assignment duty, based out of Prakith.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>Are any other Imperial officers with you?</strong> “<em>No. My fellow crewmen have little appreciation for the game.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any references to <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, Tibanna gas exchanges, or the <strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong> Medium Transport are met by blank looks and bland denials. Though <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is here to make the exchange with <strong>Darga</strong>, nothing he said above is untrue; he was chosen for the assignment because he was an excellent gambler and had a legitimate reason to be in the <strong>tournament.</strong> This first encounter should impress upon the player one thing: <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is a <strong>savvy sabacc player</strong> and could very well be the <strong>best player</strong> in the <strong>tournament.</strong> The player should see how perceptive and shrewd a card player <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is, along with one more quirk—<strong>after each hand, he stacks his cards neatly on top of one another and slides them face down back to the dealer</strong>. Lt. Arandis does this every single time, with practiced motion, like clockwork. This fact will be important on the <strong>final day</strong>, as it will reveal the identity of <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Casino Security</h3>\n<p>The first few days in the <strong>tournament</strong> go relatively smoothly for the players working security. Though <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> continually checks on their vigilance, for the most part, the players are left to their own devices. They can let their allies smuggle weapons into the casino, and they also have a chance to prove that they are doing their jobs by catching another bystander with a weapon. On the <strong>first day</strong>, a Sullustan in fine clothing comes to the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> shows his visitor pass to the guards at the door, and passes through the security checkpoint where the players are stationed. Have each player working security make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>to notice the Sullustan smuggling in a <em>blaster pistol,</em> granting them <strong>advantage</strong> for giving him a thorough search.</p>\n<p>If they uncover the weapon, they can escort the Sullustan out of the <strong>Royal.</strong> However, if they bring him to <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> instead, the casino’s owner is extremely pleased with their vigilance. As a result, he won’t notify the rest of the security team to keep tabs on the players seen talking together until <strong>day 3</strong> of the <strong>tournament</strong> (for details, see “<strong>The Crowd</strong>” above).</p>\n<p>If the players fail to uncover the weapon, there are not necessarily any negative consequences, though you can use this as a hook for introducing another encounter.</p>\n<h3>Working for Switch</h3>\n<p>For any players working for <strong>Switch,</strong> a chance arises to meet <strong>Vorn Zaday</strong>, the Neimoidian gambler recently arrived from <strong>Cato Neimoidia.</strong> She has come to enjoy herself in the tournament and has been saving up for it since the end of the Clone Wars. A stroke of luck brought her a sizable windfall—the Imperial garrison in <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> was accidentally exposed to a biological weapon left over from the Clone Wars, and her antidotes were the only thing that saved the Imperials from being wiped out. As a result, <strong>Zaday</strong> decided to take a vacation to <strong>Cloud City</strong> and test her mettle. She is very good (<strong>+7</strong> to <strong>sabacc deck checks</strong>), and though she hopes to win, she seems to just enjoy being away from the dreary, devastated world she calls her home.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>first day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> any players working for <strong>Switch</strong> notice that <strong>Zaday</strong> has been placed at the same table as <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> and the two of them seem to be doing an excellent job of wiping out the rest of the gamblers. They each seem to be winning about the same number of hands, and as their piles of <strong>credits</strong> grow, the other competitors look more and more ashen. At some point during the first few days, a break is called for, and <strong>Zaday</strong> goes to the bar for a drink, sidling up next to the players to place her order. She nods and exchanges pleasantries with the players, giving them an opportunity to ask her a few questions. As with the encounter with <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> the answers she gives could affect how they react to the <strong>final day,</strong> when they become suspicious of her presence at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Here are answers to some common questions the players might have for <strong>Zaday:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How did you get to be so good at sabacc? </strong>“<em>I used to play a lot back when I worked for the Trade Federation, before the Clone Wars.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>You were a Separatist?</strong> “<em>I didn’t have much choice. Fortunately, we avoided most of the fighting, and I was able to retire safely to Cato Neimoidia.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there any strategy you favor?</strong> “<em>Strategy? Oh, I just take each hand as it comes. Sabacc is like that; the chaos is too prevalent to make many plans.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>You’re from Cato Neimoidia?</strong> “Yes, hardly as glamorous as Cloud City. I’ve been trying to get away from that world for a long time now.”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you come to be here? </strong>“<em>I recently made some... good deals that provided me with a small windfall. Just enough to get me here for the tournament.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Do you know Darga the Hutt?</strong> “<em>I’m not familiar with any Hutts.</em>” (This is a lie. <strong>Darga </strong>brokered the deal between <strong>Zaday</strong> and the Empire, though she doesn’t want anyone to know that she would even associate with the <strong>Hutt.</strong> Players who see through her deception won’t be able to get this information out of her, though.)</li>\n<li><strong>Do you know Lt. Arandis? Are you affiliated with the Empire?</strong> “<em>I try to mind my own business. If you don’t want someone kicking down your door at night, I’d suggest you consider the same plan.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee II</strong></p>\n<p>Some time during the <strong>first two days</strong> of the tournament, the players receive another message from <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> on the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>. <strong>Crash</strong> has been intercepting a lot of transmissions that use Imperial codes, and there seems to be a good deal of communications chatter on channels not normally used by civilians. Though the droid has been able to decode only a few of the messages, it appears that the Empire is more active on <strong>Cloud City</strong> than it seems. Moreover, he’s caught references to <strong>Darga </strong>in these messages, confirming that the Hutt is still in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> though <strong>Crash</strong> has no idea where, exactly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>End of the Days' Events</h3>\n<p>By the end of the <strong>second day,</strong> only about <strong>14 competitors</strong> remain in the <strong>tournament,</strong> including <strong>Lt. Arandis, Creeska, Silas Draver, Lady Fioro,</strong> <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> and <strong>Vorn Zaday.</strong> Any players in the <strong>tournament</strong> need to make <strong>Charisma (Deception),</strong> <strong>Intelligence (sabacc deck)</strong>, or <strong>Wisdom (Insight) checks</strong>. A result of<strong> 14 or more</strong> ensures that the player moves on to the next round of the <strong>tournament,</strong> which will whittle the remaining players down to a few, final tables.</p>\n<h2>Interlude: Getting Too Close</h2>\n<p>Between the <strong>first two days</strong> and the <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> a message is delivered to the players’ suite at the <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> while the <strong>tournament</strong> is taking place. The note reads simply, “<em><strong>I know what you’re here for. Meet me on Platform 13-009 at 0200.</strong></em>” The message bears no name and is on a <em>datapad</em> resting in the middle of the floor. In truth, the pad was delivered by some of <strong>Silas Draver’s</strong> thugs, who have noticed some (or all) of the players acting strangely during the <strong>tournament. Draver</strong> doesn’t like how the players have been meddling in the <strong>tournament</strong> so far and wants to get them out of the way before the <strong>final day.</strong> He doesn’t really know why they’re present, but he suspects that they’re cheating somehow.</p>\n<p>One of <strong>Draver’s</strong> thugs sent a message to the <strong>Wing Guard,</strong> claiming that a spice deal would go down on <strong>Platform 13-009</strong> at <strong>0200. Draver</strong> hopes that the guards will detain the players for a few days, at least until the <strong>tournament’s</strong> end. With security already tense with the influx of visitors for the <strong>tournament,</strong> this does seem like a likely scenario. If the players decide to attend the meeting at the appointed time, a confrontation between the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> and the players may ensue.</p>\n<h2>On the Heights</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[WKsslx22jXa5lJbA]{3-03 On the Heights}</strong></p>\n<h2>Day 3: Last Tables</h2>\n<p>The <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> opens with a much smaller field of competitors, though it seems that the number of bystanders has not dwindled. When the players arrive at the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> for the <strong>third day</strong> of competition, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>The atmosphere in the Royal Casino is much subdued compared to that of the previous two days. Each of the competitors seems to be silently lost in concentration, having survived the free-for-all first rounds. With more than half a million credits on the line, few of the sabacc players seem to be aware of anything outside their small tables. The crowd of onlookers, just as large today as it has been for the first half of the tournament, produces a low murmur of conversation, but much of the wild revelry has died down. A Bith band plays quiet, relaxing music in one corner of the sabacc floor, and the loudest sounds are the clatter of credit chips and sabacc cards at the tables.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Casino Security</h3>\n<p>As on the previous days, any players working security can let their comrades smuggle weapons into the casino if they so choose. With fewer competitors, the security team has a bit easier time managing the crowd. However, on this day, they will have to defuse a potentially deadly situation—one of the gamblers isn’t going to accept his losses well. Midway through the <strong>third day,</strong> a Devaronian male named <strong>Szygar</strong> loses a particularly rich pot, going broke and getting eliminated from the <strong>tournament. Szygar</strong> isn’t too pleased about his loss, and he is particularly upset at <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> who won the pot. <strong>Szygar</strong> accuses the officer of cheating, and while the <strong>Lieutenant</strong> sits calmly at the table, <strong>Szygar</strong> begins ranting and yelling that <strong>Arandis</strong> has been cheating the whole time (which is not true).</p>\n<p>Players on the security team notice right away that <strong>Szygar</strong> is shaking his finger at <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> and yelling, and as they watch, the Devaronian slides a <em>hold-out blaster</em> from his sleeve, leveling it at the Imperial officer. Though <strong>Szygar</strong> doesn’t fire right away, the situation is precarious, and members of the security team will need to deal with it. <strong>Szygar</strong> is hostile toward <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> and unfriendly to everyone else, but if a member of the security team can somehow shift his attitude to indifferent through a <strong>DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he’s willing to lower the <em>blaster.</em> He still accuses <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> of cheating, demanding that the officer be removed from the <strong>tournament</strong> and his winnings turned over to <strong>Szygar.</strong> If the players can convince the Devaronian to leave peacefully and turn over his blaster, they will have successfully stopped a potentially deadly situation. However, they do not necessarily need to defuse the situation; if they have the means, they can try to take <strong>Szygar</strong> down violently</p>\n<p>For <strong>Szygar,</strong> use the statistics for <strong>Silas Draver’s goons</strong> from the “<strong>Sabacc Table Showdown</strong>” encounter. If combat breaks out, use the map from the “<strong>Sabacc Table Showdown</strong>” encounter. Also, keep in mind that it’s best for <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> to survive this encounter. His presence in the final round of the <strong>tournament</strong> will facilitate the revelation of <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> as <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Bystanders</h3>\n<p>The players in the crowd will have a chance to come face to face with <strong>Darga’s agent </strong>in the <strong>tournament, Lady Mirana Fioro.</strong> The Hapan woman has been doing quite well so far, and it already looks as though she will be one of the competitors to make it to the final table. At some point during the <strong>third day,</strong> <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> takes a break and walks to one of the the observation decks, which happens to be near where any players in the crowd are standing. The observation deck looks out over <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and the orange-red of the setting sun casts the entire deck in a bright glow. <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> looks radiant in this light, and though she retains her unreadable exterior, some players might be tempted to talk to her about the competition. Although she keeps the conversation to a minimum, she is not precisely uncivil, and the players can learn a little more about her, which will help confirm on the <strong>final day</strong> that she is <strong>Darga’s agent</strong> and give the players a chance to follow her after the <strong>tournament</strong> is over.</p>\n<p>Below are answers to some common questions the players might have for <strong>Lady Fioro:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why are you playing in the tournament?</strong> \"<em>The money, is, of course, no object for me. But someone has to show this riff-raff that someone will always be their superior</em>\"</li>\n<li><strong>What do you think of the tournament so far?</strong> “<em>I am surprised that some of these players have gotten so far. Of course, many things surprise me here. I would have thought that my room in the famed Yerith Bespin hotel would be a little nicer than the peasant hovels on Hapes, but I can see that I was mistaken</em>.”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you become so good at sabacc?</strong> “<em>My late husband taught me the game. He was an exceptional player, but before his death I had surpassed him.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there any particular strategy you favour?</strong> “<em>The only way to play sabacc is to play aggressively. Anything less is certain to fail.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>Do you know Darga the Hutt? Have you dealt with the Empire?</strong> “<em>Such nonsense. I’m here to play sabacc and win, and that’s all.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Working for Switch</h3>\n<p>On the <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>tournament, Switch</strong> sends a message to the players, which is delivered by the hotel staff of the <strong>Yerith Bespin. Switch</strong> has heard that <strong>Captain Moro</strong> is doing well, but he would like to help the Twi’lek reach the final round of the competition. The droid crime lord has sent the players a piece of software for the <strong>sabacc dealer droids</strong> that will twist the luck of the draw in <strong>Moro’s</strong> favor. The tricky part is that the players will have to physically insert a memory stick into the dealer droid to upload the software, a difficult prospect given the heightened security surrounding the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>The players should come up with a plan for installing the software. They might choose to disguise themselves as technicians performing maintenance on the droid, though such a deception would be difficult to believe, especially for <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot.</strong> Players can attempt to slide the memory stick into the dealer droid when no one is looking, and if other players create a distraction of some kind, it can give the player with the stick <strong>advantage</strong> on a <strong>Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>When the players attempt to insert the cheating software, use the statistics from the <strong>On the Heights</strong> encounter for <strong>Bespin Security Guards</strong> for the rest of the security team. You can also throw other complications at the players to keep them on their toes. For example, another <strong>technician</strong> might walk up and start tinkering with the droid just as the player approaches it, or one of the other <strong>sabacc players</strong> might turn to face the droid at just the wrong moment. These complications can add tension to the scene, but they shouldn’t stop the players from completing this minor task.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if the players don’t care about helping <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> they can alter the software so that it provides <strong>advantage</strong> on <strong>Intelligence (sabacc deck) checks</strong> to one of their allies instead. A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check </strong>alters the software to help out a particular player, but the software still has to be installed in one of the dealer droids.</p>\n<h3>End of the Day's Events</h3>\n<p>By the end of the <strong>third day,</strong> only <strong>seven</strong> or <strong>eight</strong> competitors should remain in the tournament, including <strong>Lt. Arandis, Creeska, Silas Draver, Lady Fioro,</strong> <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> and <strong>Vorn Zaday.</strong> Any players playing in the <strong>tournament</strong> need to make <strong>Charisma (Deception), Intelligence (sabacc deck)</strong>, or <strong>Wisdom (Insight) checks</strong>. A result of <strong>18</strong> or more ensures that the player moves on to the next round of the <strong>tournament,</strong> which will determine the champion. If two or more players are playing in the <strong>tournament,</strong> only the player who gets the <strong>highest result</strong> advances to the <strong>final table</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee III</strong></p>\n<p>Some time during the <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> the players receive another message from <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> on the <em><strong>Banshee</strong>.</em> According to <strong>Crash,</strong> Imperial communications chatter has died down, and the reason seems to be that <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> made it to the final table in the <strong>tournament.</strong> Apparently, the Empire had a contingency plan in place on the off chance that <strong>Arandis</strong> didn’t reach the final table on his own.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>Crash</strong> has been monitoring communications from the Medium Transport <strong>Shackles of Nizon,</strong> which is still in orbit over the planet. He has been picking up infrequent signals from the ship that are consistent with signals used by slave circuits, which are used to control starships from a distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Day 4: Final Round</h2>\n<p>On the <strong>final day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> the only competitors left are those who have played a significant role in the adventure thus far. If a player has made it to the <strong>final table,</strong> he or she has the chance to become the next champion of the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> and be known as one of the most talented players in the galaxy. More importantly, though, the players will learn the identity of <strong>Darga’s agent</strong> and the details of the exchange, and they will also be on the right path to finding the <strong>Hutt</strong> and bringing him to justice.</p>\n<p>Only one table remains on the <strong>final day</strong> of the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> Each of the competitors is intensely focused on the hand of <strong>sabacc cards</strong> in front of them, and there is a tension in the air as they compete to see who will take home an incredible prize. All eyes are on the central table, and the Bith band from the day before produces only the faintest background music. The crowd has not thinned, but it now surrounds the last table, which is illuminated by lights from overhead. With the house lights dimmed, the <strong>final table</strong> in the middle of the room glows like an incandescent torch in the dark casino.</p>\n<h3>Casino Security</h3>\n<p>As the <strong>final day</strong> of the tournament wears on, any players working security have a chance to catch <strong>Creeska,</strong> the Rodian player, cheating with a <strong>skifter.</strong> A <strong>skifter</strong> is a special <strong>sabacc card</strong> that can be changed by tapping on the correct corner of the card. Allow each player working security a <strong>DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>to notice <strong>Creeska</strong> slipping the <strong>skifter</strong> from his coat during one of the <strong>sabacc</strong> hands. If a player notices the <strong>skifter,</strong> he can point it out to the rest of the <strong>security team</strong> or to <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot. Creeska</strong> is arrested, all the while protesting his innocence, and dragged off by the <strong>security force.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players do not notice <strong>Creeska</strong> cheating, he retains the <strong>skifter</strong> but loses and gets eliminated from the <strong>tournament</strong> anyway. Unfortunately, he uses the <strong>skifter</strong> to win hands against both <strong>Captain Moro</strong> and any player still in the tournament, <strong>disadvantage</strong> on their <strong>checks</strong> to gamble at the end of the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<h3>Bystanders</h3>\n<p>On the <strong>final day</strong> of the <strong>tournament, Silas Draver</strong> pays a handsome bribe to a member of the <strong>Royal’s security force</strong> to get his comrades into the <strong>casino</strong> with their <strong>weapons.</strong> Allow any players in the crowd to make a <strong>DC 17 Perception check</strong> to notice several of <strong>Draver’s thugs</strong> being let in with their weapons by the <strong>security guard.</strong> If the <strong>check</strong> is successful, the players can report what they saw to any member of the <strong>security force.</strong> An investigation reveals the <strong>two thugs</strong> who smuggled in weapons, as well as the <strong>guard</strong> who was bribed. If the players successfully reveal <strong>Draver’s thugs,</strong> remove <strong>two</strong> of his <strong>goons</strong> from the “<strong>Sabacc Table Showdown</strong>” <strong>encounter,</strong> but award <strong>XP</strong> as though the party had defeated those <strong>two goons</strong> just the same.</p>\n<h3>Working for Switch</h3>\n<p>Despite his successes earlier in the <strong>tournament,</strong> <strong>Captain Moro</strong> is not faring well on this <strong>final day.</strong> If the players did not already introduce themselves to <strong>Moro</strong> as agents of <strong>Switch,</strong> the droid sends a message to the Twi’lek, explaining that the players are there to help him. During breaks in the action, <strong>Moro</strong> may seek out the players for counsel in the final round of the <strong>tournament.</strong> If they choose, they can advise him on his play, using observations they have made in the first few days to increase his chances of success. One player working for <strong>Switch</strong> can make a <strong>DC 13 Wisdom check</strong> to aid <strong>Captain Moro</strong> on his own <strong>checks</strong> to gamble at the end of the <strong>fourth day,</strong> granting him <strong>advantage.</strong></p>\n<p>Furthermore, if the players interacted with <strong>Vorn Zaday</strong> earlier in the <strong>tournament,</strong> they can tip <strong>Moro</strong> off to her personality, particularly if they reveal her <strong>“chaotic”</strong> outlook on the game. Doing so imposes <strong>disadvantage</strong> on <strong>Zaday’s checks</strong> to gamble at the end of the <strong>tournament,</strong> decreasing the chance that she will beat <strong>Moro’s check.</strong> Similarly, if any of the players managed to talk to <strong>Lady Fioro,</strong> they can impose <strong>disadvantage</strong> on her <strong>check</strong> to gamble by revealing her <strong>aggressive strategy</strong> to <strong>Moro.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee IV</strong></p>\n<p>Just before the players witness the exchange below between <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> and <strong>Lady Fioro,</strong> <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> contacts them via <em>comlink</em> to say that Imperial chatter has exploded to a new high, and that the exchange must be close to occurring. This should keep the players on the alert for the final round of the <strong>tournament,</strong> and it can help any players who are struggling to identify <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Tournament Competitors</h3>\n<p>Near the end of the <strong>tournament</strong> (this should be the last scenario before the final <strong>gamble checks</strong> are made), the players finally have a chance to learn the truth about which gambler is working for <strong>Darga</strong>. One particular hand comes about in which <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> has a clear advantage. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Lady Fioro holds her hand close to her chest, a confident smile gracing her lips. One by one, the other competitors fold, until only the Imperial officer Lt. Arandis and the Hapan woman remain in the game. Another round of betting raises the stakes, but it seems as though Lt. Arandis is feeling out her hand. He watches her for a long moment, eyeing her with the same savvy look he has given every other player he has defeated over the course of the tournament.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>“<em><strong>I will wager every credit I have,</strong></em>” he says, pushing a pile of chips to the center of the table. The crowd gasps, but the other players—all except <strong>Lady Fioro—look</strong> confused. Her smile, however, deepens, and she reveals her hand: <strong>pure sabacc</strong>, the best possible hand in the game.</p>\n<p>A cheer erupts from the crowd, but it is what happens next that draws your eye. <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> tosses his cards haphazardly on the table, but as the <strong>credit chips</strong> are slid across the table to <strong>Lady Fioro,</strong> he begins arranging the cards once more. From left to right, he places the <strong>One</strong> <strong>of Coins</strong>, the <strong>Three of Sabers</strong>, the <strong>Seven of Flasks</strong>, then <strong>two credit</strong> chips, followed by <strong>Master of Staves</strong>, and lastly the <strong>Queen of Air and Darkness</strong>, sliding them all into the neutral field to keep them from shifting. An instant later, you notice that they produce a number sequence: 137.12. While the audience cheers, <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> stares intently at the cards, as though burning the sequence into her mind.</p>\n<p>Based on their earlier interactions with <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> the players should know that such a play was highly irregular for him. Normally, he is conservative and is not easily baited by bluffs, but his play at the end seemed to indicate that he had been tricked into wagering his entire stake. Not only does the loss remove <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> from the <strong>tournament</strong> (a fact that he seems to show no remorse for), it also gives <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> a significant advantage going into the final hands of the <strong>tournament,</strong> as his stake was quite sizable.</p>\n<p>Additionally, his behavior at the end of the hand should rouse the players’ suspicions, especially given that he specifically arranged the cards to produce the numeric sequence and slid them into the neutral field to keep them from randomizing. If the players have not already figured it out, allow them to make an<strong> Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> to realize that the numeric sequence corresponds to a <strong>communications frequency </strong>used by starships, particularly<strong> slave circuits</strong>.</p>\n<p>They should realize what has transpired: <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> transferred his winnings to <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> so that she would win the <strong>tournament,</strong> and he also communicated the frequency of the <strong>slave circuit</strong> for the <strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong> . <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> is <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>, and the players should know this now. Unfortunately, before they have a chance to confront her, they will have to deal with <strong>Silas Draver</strong> and his <strong>goons.</strong></p>\n<p>If no players are participating in the <strong>tournament</strong> at this point, this scenario can play out for <strong>bystanders</strong> as well (especially if any players who met <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> on the <strong>first day</strong> are still present in the audience).</p>\n<h3>End of the Day's Events</h3>\n<p>At the end of the <strong>final day,</strong> only a small number of competitors remain: <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> (<strong>+8</strong> to their<strong> checks</strong>), <strong>Captain Moro</strong> (<strong>+5</strong> to their <strong>checks), Vorn Zaday</strong> (<strong>+7</strong> to their <strong>checks),</strong> and (if applicable) the player participating in the <strong>tournament.</strong> Have these competitors make<strong> Charisma (Deception)</strong>, <strong>Intelligence (sabacc deck)</strong>, or <strong>Wisdom (Insight) checks</strong>. The character with the highest result wins the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> Though this will determine the winner, at least one NPC does not have a chance to win: <strong>Silas Draver.</strong></p>\n<h2>Concluding the Tournament</h2>\n<p>Once the victor of the <strong>tournament</strong> has been determined, <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> comes to the table to congratulate the winner. In a ceremony as much for the crowd as for the winner, <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> drones on about the excellent competition. He has had the <strong>credits</strong> transferred to a special account that only the <strong>tournament</strong> winner can access, and he hands over a datapad containing the access codes for the account. The crowd cheers, and things finally seem to be winding down, when <strong>Silas Draver</strong> decides to make his move.</p>\n<p><strong>Draver</strong> is not one to take losing kindly, and as such he has prepared for this contingency in advance. <strong>Draver</strong> draws a weapon, and several of his goons push forward out of the crowd, threatening to kill <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> and many others if the <em>datapad</em> isn’t handed over. Surprisingly, most of the <strong>tournament’s</strong> competitors and spectators abided by the “<strong>no weapons</strong>” rule, so none is able to stop <strong>Draver</strong> and his <strong>thugs.</strong> To demonstrate how serious he is, <strong>Draver</strong> activates special programming he had installed into <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>sabacc dealer droids,</strong> revealing them to be armed with blaster weapons.</p>\n<p>The players will need to deal with <strong>Draver</strong> to keep him from getting away with the <strong>credits.</strong> Additionally, he points his blaster at <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> and threatens to take her hostage to keep him safe all the way to the landing pad where his ship is waiting.</p>\n<h2>Sabacc Table Showdown</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[Kv8ka6rkvypUYHPg]{3-04 Sabacc Table Showdown}</strong></p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"gSGEUx2pA0DA8wRU","name":"Part 1: Cato Neimoidia","content":"<h1>Part 1: Cato Neimoidia</h1>\n<p>In<em><strong> A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, the heroes must travel to the world of <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, a planet ravaged by the Clone Wars and one of the many colony worlds of the Neimoidian people. Since their last adventure, the heroes have spent some downtime aboard the Nebulon-B frigate <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, which is apparently owned by <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. The ship spends all of its time in deep space, between worlds and away from major hyperspace routes, and it currently serves as a mobile safe house for former Imperial <strong>Admiral Gilder Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> was recently rescued from an Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> (either by the heroes, if they played in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, or by other agents of<strong> Bail Organa </strong>if they didn’t) and brought to the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>to be debriefed. <strong>Captain Adrian Verana</strong> is the commanding officer of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, and he has overseen <strong>Varth’s</strong> safety and debriefing over the last few weeks. The whole time, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> has made it clear that no one should mention <strong>Bail Organa’s </strong>name because the Senator cannot risk being known to be involved in case the Empire happens upon the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. Even <strong>Gilder Varth</strong> does not know for certain that it was <strong>Organa </strong>who had him rescued (unless the heroes told him, of course).</p>\n<p>In the time between the end of <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em> and the beginning of <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, you should feel free to include encounters with <strong>Captain Verana</strong>, <strong>Gilder Varth</strong>, and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> (the owner and operator of the Baudo -class Star Yacht, the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>). The heroes should get to know these three characters a bit better because all of them will have roles of varying importance throughout the campaign. When <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em> opens, the heroes should be fully healed and have had a chance to obtain needed supplies and resources. The <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> is a well-stocked ship and can provide the group with most mundane items.</p>\n<h2>The Briefing</h2>\n<p>The adventure begins when the heroes are summoned to the briefing room aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. When they arrive, they find that <strong>Gilder Varth</strong> awaits them, now dressed in the uniform of an Alderaanian ship officer. At his side is a small yellow-and silver astromech droid that whistles softly as it interfaces with a computer system. Once the heroes arrive, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The briefing room aboard the </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Resurgence</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> is clean and white, with several benches wrapping smoothly around a holographic projector seated on a raised dais in the center of the room. The projector springs to life, and the blue-tinted hologram of a Hutt appears to hover a few inches away from the projector’s three curved prongs. With a brusque clearing of his throat, former Imperial officer </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Gilder Varth</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> begins to speak, wasting little time on pleasantries.</span></em></p>\n<p><em>“Before the Empire decided my conscience was a liability,” he says, “I was involved peripherally in a top-secret plan known as the Sarlacc Project. While the details of the project are unknown to me, I was involved in the transfer of large sums of credits and resources to the project. Whatever the project entails, it is taking up a lot of the Empire’s time and effort. Moreover, I believe that this Sarlacc Project is destroying the lives of thousands of sentient beings; casualty reports crossed my desk on a regular basis.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Unfortunately, I don’t know much more than that. However, during my brief brushes with the project, I discovered that the Imperial Navy was hiding the program’s existence from the Senate by transferring resources through secondary sources. Resources were routed through the Corporate Sector, through fake contractors, and through the criminal underworld to keep a trail from leading back to the project.</em></p>\n<p><em>“One such secondary source was a Hutt crime lord named Darga. Like all Hutts, Darga is a slimy gangster whose love of credits is exceeded only by his love of power. Part of my job involved transferring resources to Darga, and in turn arranging for Imperial agents to take control of other resources from the Hutt’s organization. These were not simply transfers of credits. The items being traded were not specified, but physical resources were definitely being exchanged. Though it’s not much, this is the only lead we have. “Captain Verana has charged me with helping to uncover more about the Sarlacc Project, and he has authorized me to use you as my agents. We need you to travel to the planet of Cato Neimoidia and find Darga the Hutt. See if you can learn what he is trading in and how it relates to the Sarlacc Project.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> keeps the briefing short and sweet. He has an air about him that immediately recalls his military past; though he is not unfriendly, he spares no time for idle chatter. It should be clear to the heroes that <strong>Varth</strong> has not adjusted to life outside of the Imperial Navy; he still acts with the same rigidity that is characteristic of all Imperial officers. He seems uncomfortable in his Alderaanian uniform, but his professionalism won’t allow him to voice any complaints. The man is all business, and though he seems genuine in his assertions, he remains largely unreadable. After the briefing, the heroes might have some questions about their mission. The following section provides answers to common questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why should we do this for you?</strong> “<em>In exchange for your assistance, Captain Verana has authorized me to pay each of you a modest sum. Additionally, this may be a chance to discover what the Empire is planning with the Sarlacc Project—which could have big repercussions if I am right.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What else do you know about the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>Not much more than I’ve told you. My only involvement came in managing resources, and most of those transactions were encoded.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How are we supposed to find Darga the Hutt? </strong>“<em>Unfortunately, Darga’s exact whereabouts are unknown. However, he has been seen in the Cato Neimoidian city of Zarra. Chances are that someone in the city knows where he is.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How do we discover the extent of Darga’s involvement in the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>Darga is not one to give up his secrets easily, but he has been known to take associates into his trust. If you can get inside his palace, he might reveal what is going on—or you might be able to find out by snooping around.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What can you tell us about Zarra?</strong> “<em>Zarra was heavily damaged during the Clone Wars, and half of the city is still in ruins. The few residents that have chosen to remain inhabit a cluster of settlements on one end of the city.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How are we supposed to get to Cato Neimoidia?</strong> “<em>Captain Verana has chartered passage for you aboard the Banshee, the transport vessel captained by Sirona Okeefe. After helping you rescue me from my prison on Felucia, Captain Okeefe quickly found herself on retainer.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/resurgence_nebulon-b_escort_frigate_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[SyI9doYoK0fiAtkf]{09 - Handout 9 - Resurgence}</p>\n<h2>Arrival</h2>\n<p>The trip to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> is uneventful, and when the heroes arrive, they find a planet that is far from its former glory in the days before the Clone Wars. A world in the <strong>Colonies</strong>, <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> should be far more populated than it is. When the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>drops out of hyperspace, any heroes in the cockpit can see that there is very little traffic traveling to and from the world. As the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>descends toward the planet, the ship flies through layers of clouds and zooms over cities that are built on massive bridges between rock arches. However, the bridge cities are all but abandoned, seemingly left to rot after the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>The heroes land on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> with no difficulty and no visible Imperial presence. The <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>docks at a spaceport in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and though propaganda posters line the spaceport walls, there is no sign of <strong>stormtroopers</strong> or other Imperial officials. Regardless, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> cautions the heroes against acting foolishly. The Empire still controls the planet, and though its current presence is not strong, the situation could change quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Zarra</strong> itself is dilapidated to the point of being hazardous. As the heroes walk the streets, they see little in the way of authority or commerce. Several large buildings that appear to have been lavish palaces of Neimoidian merchants lie half toppled and mostly destroyed. Rubble litters the streets, and landspeeders must veer sharply to avoid chunks of permacrete lying haphazardly in the road. Though a number of beings, mostly shabby-looking Neimoidians, roam the streets, it is clear that <strong>Zarra </strong>has been nearly abandoned since the Clone Wars.</p>\n<h2>Sample Citizens</h2>\n<p>During this part of the adventure, the heroes might come into contact with members of the local populace. Below are several <strong>Cato Neimoidian</strong> citizens to use as quick reference when the heroes begin moving about the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>. Each uses the typical statistics block below. Feel free to invent your own NPCs or introduce other characters here as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Krett, Cantina Owner:</strong> Male Neimoidian, owns the <strong>Federation’s Folly</strong>, a cantina in <strong>Zarra</strong>. A veteran of the Clone Wars, Krett once commanded a Lucrehulk-class battleship but was exiled to <strong>Cato Neimoidia </strong>and is still bitter.</li>\n<li><strong>Nillia, Spaceport Administrator:</strong> Female Neimoidian, keeps tabs on all the ships coming and going from <strong>Zarra</strong>. She is bored with her job and longs to leave, and she seems wistful, as if seeking something more.</li>\n<li><strong>Vigro, Speeder Repairman:</strong> Male Neimoidian, operates <strong>Vigro’s Repulsorlifts</strong>, a landspeeder repair shop. He is suspicious of outsiders and believes that even honest customers are out to swindle him.</li>\n<li><strong>Salitt, Beggar:</strong> Male Neimoidian who begs on the streets of <strong>Zarra</strong>. He claims that he was once the Viceroy of the Trade Federation (he wasn’t) and seems distinctly deluded and paranoid.</li>\n<li><strong>Shass, Trader: </strong>Female Neimoidian, owner of <strong>Zarran Imports and Exports</strong>. A shrewd businesswoman, she had aspirations of rising through the ranks of the Trade Federation until the blockade of Naboo, when she refused to go any further in a corrupt organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Desson, Laborer:</strong> Male Neimoidian who works to rebuild <strong>Zarra</strong>. Desson seems like a man whose aspirations have been trod on for too long, such that now he is merely going through the motions.</li>\n<li><strong>Borlo, Imperial Informant:</strong> Male Neimoidian who earns his keep by feeding information to the Empire about any unusual happenings. He seems friendly and outgoing, but his eyes glisten with the promise of Imperial credits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KTzw2sOaWqPYAj0K]{Cato Neimoidian Citizen}</strong></p>\n<h2>A Visit from the Vipers</h2>\n<p>As the heroes arrive on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong>, they are hassled by a local swoop gang. The <strong>Vipers,</strong> a rough gang of thugs who terrorize <strong>Zarra</strong> on a daily basis, always look for fresh prey when an outlander starship arrives. The swoop gang’s leader is a violent Human woman named <strong>Kessra.</strong> She is the only female member of the gang, but she bears the scars of several past battles. From the <strong>Vipers’</strong> demeanor, it is clear that they follow her unquestioningly. However, they don’t realize that <strong>Kessra</strong> sometimes takes small jobs from <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. She uses her gang to achieve the crime lord’s goals in <strong>Zarra</strong>.</p>\n<p>As the heroes depart the spaceport where the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is docked, the <strong>Vipers</strong> ride in quickly and surround the party. <strong>Kessra</strong> taunts the heroes from the back of her swoop bike, claiming that they’ve failed to pay for a landing permit from the <strong>Vipers.</strong> If they wish to pass unharmed, they’ll have to dole out <strong>1,000 credits</strong> each. The heroes can pay the outlandish extortion fee, and if they do, <strong>Kessra</strong> pegs them as easy targets and leads the <strong>Vipers</strong> away—for now. But the whole time that the heroes stay in <strong>Zarra</strong>, gang members continue to shake them down for more money. They might even try <strong>attacking </strong>the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>if the heroes don’t eventually put up a fight, and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is not pleased about having to drive off a gang of bikers.</p>\n<p>If the heroes refuse to pay the exorbitant amount that the <strong>Vipers</strong> demand, the swoop gang launches an <strong>attack</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Swoop Marauders</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: <strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@JournalEntry[lf6mpWl6C4UXlNma]{2-01 Swoop Marauders}</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/Kessra_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"750\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@JournalEntry[T9pbtvnEabrgEbUE]{03 - Handout 3 - Kessra}</span></p>\n<h2>Locating Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>With nothing more to go on than a city and the name of a Hutt, the heroes don’t have many leads to follow. Asking questions about a Hutt crime lord can be a dangerous business in <strong>Zarra</strong>, and most citizens rebuff the heroes if they try. However, after a few attempts to find <strong>Darga</strong>, the heroes should come to realize that the Hutt lives in the city and is, in fact, well known, even if no one will reveal his exact location. But there is one way for the heroes to learn where <strong>Darga </strong>resides. One of his flunkies, a young Devaronian thief and errand boy named<strong> Warrick “Womp Rat” Raden</strong>, spends a great deal of time in the city. If the heroes can locate <strong>Raden</strong>, he can lead them directly to the Hutt’s secret <strong>palace</strong>. Below are some suggestions on how to handle the search for <strong>Raden</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Heroes who are trained in the <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) skill</strong> have an advantage in trying to find the Hutt. Though they cannot locate <strong><em>Darga</em> </strong>with the skill, they can find <strong>Raden</strong>, who takes pains to keep his movements low key (if not secret). A hero can use <strong>Intelligence (Investigation)</strong> to find him; the <strong>DC</strong> is <strong>25</strong> and the information costs <strong>500 credits</strong> in bribes. Success indicates that the heroes are told where to find <strong>Raden</strong>—a nearby ruined warehouse.</p>\n<p><strong>False Pretenses:</strong> The heroes might try to gain the attention of the Hutt and his associates through deception. This might include pretending to be a rival gang eager to start trouble or posing as fellow criminals looking to work with (or for) the Hutt. However, most citizens of <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> want nothing to do with the underworld, so if the heroes identify themselves as criminals of any kind, the residents shun them or refuse to do business with them.</p>\n<p>If the heroes spread rumors in an attempt to draw the Hutt’s interest, it takes <strong>two days</strong> before they see results. Provided that they didn’t spread rumors likely to provoke the crime lord (such as “<em><strong>We’re here to kill that slimy Hutt and take over this planet for our own!</strong></em>”), they receive an anonymous message telling them to meet <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> at the ruined warehouse at midnight. The message actually comes from one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>informants in <strong>Zarra</strong>, not from <strong>Raden</strong> himself, so the errand boy knows nothing of the heroes’ impending arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Bribery:</strong> No matter how much the citizens fear dealing with the criminal underworld, the right amount of credits can always open doors If the heroes visit traders, cantinas, spaceports, and even security offices searching for information on <strong>Darga</strong>, the right bribes can get them the information they need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bribe of <strong>100 credits</strong> or less reveals no information regarding <strong>Darga</strong>, only that “<em><strong>some Hutt</strong></em>” has been terrorizing the people of <strong>Zarra</strong>.</li>\n<li>A bribe of <strong>101</strong> to <strong>500 credits</strong> earns the heroes the name of the Hutt’s associate, <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, and lowers the <strong>DC</strong> on an<strong> Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> by <strong>10</strong> to locate the errand boy.</li>\n<li>A bribe of more than <strong>500 credits</strong> earns the heroes not only <strong>Warrick Raden’s</strong> name but also the location of the abandoned warehouse where he can be found.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Threats and Violence: </strong>Though more in line with the Empire’s tactics, the heroes can use threats and violence to get information about <strong>Darga</strong>. Most of the population of <strong>Zarra </strong>is already cowed by the Hutt’s thugs and associates. Combined with occasional Imperial intervention, which never goes well even for law-abiding citizens, the locals have very little fight left in them.</p>\n<p>Using the <strong>Charisma (Intimidation) skill</strong> to intimidate citizens of <strong>Zarra </strong>only goes so far. A successfully intimidated citizen can say only that a Devaronian named <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> works for <strong>Darga </strong>and sometimes comes around to collect extortion money or deliver messages on the Hutt’s behalf. This information grants the same <strong>-10 DC bonus </strong>on <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong> that bribery does.</p>\n<p>If the heroes use violence to find <strong>Darga</strong>, such as abusing local business owners or picking a fight in a cantina, they eventually get a message from one of the Hutt’s hidden agents who believes that the heroes are auditioning to join the organization. This message is identical to the one described under “<strong>False Pretenses</strong>,” above.</p>\n<p>However, violence does not sit well with the citizens of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and eventually one becomes scared enough to alert Imperial authorities to the heroes’ activities. An Imperial patrol consisting of <strong>six stormtroopers</strong> and an <strong>Imperial Junior Officer</strong> arrives on a transport skiff and attempts to take the heroes into custody. The Imperials call for reinforcements if the heroes resist arrest, and soon <strong>Zarra </strong>might be crawling with a large percentage of the Imperial forces on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, attracting attention the heroes do not want.</p>\n<p><strong>6 @Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{Stormtroopers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[56Fie9duL2tF66az]{Imperial Junior Officer}</strong></p>\n<h2>Finding Raden</h2>\n<p>When the heroes finally locate <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, they quickly discover that he does not want to be found or to talk about <strong>Darga</strong>. The Devaronian is willing to fight his way free and is not afraid to fire a few blaster bolts to put the heroes off his scent.</p>\n<h2>Darga's Cronies</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: <strong>@JournalEntry[p0XJ99N93haUpXn1]{2-02 Darga's Cronies}</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/Warrick_Raden_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"594\" /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[lFfUtmlMoAzMT0Fs]{04 - Handout 4 - Warrick Raden}</strong></p>","folder":"DUb0crJ7IJjaqUGJ","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Afterward, read the following text aloud to them. It takes place in a briefing room aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, where <strong>Master Denia</strong> briefs the heroes on a new mission.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"“Your help to our cause in the last few months has been invaluable and your dedication exemplary. During my recovery, I had time to reflect on our goal—to discover the purpose of the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While studying at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, I learned about holocrons—recording devices into which Jedi stored their wisdom to pass on to future generations. Some holocrons, such as the prized Tedryn Holocron of Jedi Master Ashka Boda, were tailored toward helping Jedi Masters penetrate the secrets of the <strong>Force.</strong> Even beings already trained in the Jedi ways, like myself, greatly benefit from such a source of learning.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I summoned you because the <strong>Force</strong> has pulled together threads of knowledge to reveal the location of a holocron similar to the Tedryn. Some time before I traveled to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, Master Ashka Boda contacted me with news that he had joined the former Almas Academy student Halagad Ventor in trying to form a network between the scattered Jedi survivors of the destruction of the academy. During the Clone Wars, an orbital bombardment decimated the academy in the Cularin system, and if any artifacts have survived, common sense suggests that they have since been stolen. But the <strong>Force</strong> tells me that the holocron we require is there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I’ve never been to the planet Almas in person, but I knew the headmaster there, a serene Jedi Master named Lanius Qel-Bertuk. I have no current information on the planet, but I can provide you with coordinates and a path through the treacherous comet cloud that surrounds the Cularin system. These were obtained at great expense thanks to <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> vast connections.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I feel this is crucial to our cause, because I have sensed a link between the Sarlacc Project and the slaves that you rescued above <strong>Bespin</strong>. But I have probed the <strong>Force</strong> tirelessly and at last reached my limits. With this Jedi holocron, however, I might expand my ability to see through the <strong>Force</strong> and find the answers we seek. Furthermore, I will be able to pass on the lessons it contains to a future generation of Jedi, thus coming one step closer to restoring peace and justice to the galaxy.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The coordinates to Cularin are programmed into the nav computer of the heroes' ship, which should be consulted for additional information about the system. If the heroes have more questions before the mission starts, you should clarify or repeat only what <strong>Master Denia</strong> already told them. Don’t reveal too much, aside from what the player's <strong>Intelligence (Lore) checks</strong> entitle them to know about Almas.

This dead zone is cold and lifeless, and full environment suits are required to survive in it. The area has grown steadily for centuries and now has reached the academy’s doorstep</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC15 In the heart of the wasteland is an ancient Sith fortress, which was abandoned about a<strong> thousand years ago</strong>. The wasteland has grown at an estimated radius of <strong>3 feet per year</strong>, though the death of kaluthin was further accelerated recently, starting about <strong>13 years ago</strong> with sabotage by a dark side cult called the Believers. Since the razing of the Almas Academy, however, a radical surge in the dead zone has occurred. The wasteland now encompasses a radius of 3,100 miles, with a trail that leads straight to the ghost town of Forard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC20 It is rumored that the Sith Lord who built the fortress around <strong>1,150</strong> to <strong>1,400 years ago</strong> also created the kaluthin, combining his knowledge of bioengineering with the power of the <strong>Force.</strong> The kaluthin ability to synthesize the atmosphere of an entire planet is still considered an amazing achievement today. Until recently, scientists researched ways of transplanting the glowing grass to other worlds, but met with little success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Intelligence (Lore)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 10 Almas is the fourth and outermost planet in the Cularin system. Over a <strong>thousand years ago</strong>, a plant named kaluthin took root on the icy, lifeless world, nourishing itself from large underground lakes. Over time, the kaluthin synthesized the planet’s poisonous atmosphere (composed in large part of methane and phosphorus) into enough oxygen to sustain carbon-based life. Still, prolonged exposure can be hazardous to one's health due to trace amounts of toxins, and breath masks or atmospheric regulators are strongly recommended.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 15 The local nights on Almas are not determined by the distant twin suns. Wherever kaluthin grow (everywhere except in the dead zone), their phosphorus-filled leaves absorb the moonlight and make the surface of the planet glow. It takes a while for newcomers to adjust to the dusk to dawn cycles, which are determined by the kaluthin’s leaves being either spread open or closed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 20 A century and a half ago, the Jedi established a training academy on Almas. The town of Forard was subsequently built, forming a circle around the Jedi academy. Several sadrin farms were found wherever kaluthin grew. All were recently abandoned, however, shortly after the academy was destroyed. Now the academy ruins and the surrounding town buildings are regularly despoiled by salvagers looking for valuable loot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 25 The academy was attacked at the end of the Clone Wars by three starships, which took the resident Jedi by surprise. One was a Cularin Allied Force ship that was brought down by Jedi starfighters and crashed into the academy grounds. Another was a mercenary vessel destroyed by allies of the Jedi. The third was a black starfighter that fled shortly after the assault, possibly carrying the party responsible for the attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes exit hyperspace, read the following text aloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Several hours after leaving the Corellian Run, your starship exits hyperspace at the calculated point just outside the Cularin system. Exactly as you were warned by <strong>Master Denia</strong>, you notice innumerable comets of all shapes and sizes occasionally colliding with each other, forming an enormous cloud around the system. Fortunately, you were supplied with a sensor package that analyzes their erratic patterns and calculates a safe path through the cloud. Once past that danger, another jump must be calculated to avoid flying for <strong>weeks</strong> at sublight speeds. However, this time the calculations are trickier due to large, overlapping gravity wells created by the system’s dense planet cores. But you know people who’ve made the Kessel Run, and this can’t be worse than skirting the Maw cluster. An hour later, you again emerge from hyperspace and the planet farthest from Cularin’s twin suns comes into view, lambent and mysterious: Almas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first thing you notice from orbit is the strange luminescence that emanates from the planet itself. The twin suns are too distant to illuminate the planet, and you are approaching from the side facing away from them. Yet most of the surface emits a faint glow, except for one dark spot where the Jedi academy happens to be located according to your nav computer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ALMAS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As soon as they near Almas, the heroes’ starship sensors start beeping, alerting them to a nearby ship. A modified consular-class cruiser was hiding in orbit close to planet’s moon Dorumaa and is now coming at them fast, with cannons and tractor beams trained on the heroes’ ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since the destruction of the Almas Academy, the pirates of the Red Fury Brotherhood emerged as the dominant corsairs in the Cularin system. Inquisitor Draco cut a deal to have them patrol the orbit of Almas while he investigates the darkness saturating the planet. Policing duties have fallen to one of the Red Fury’s most hardhearted and arrogant swashbucklers, the pirate Reddjak. His menacing scarlet vessel, the Blood Brother, tries to ensnare and board the heroes’ ship within moments of its arrival.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SEEING RED</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LANDING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nav computer instructs the heroes to land near the abandoned cluster of buildings formerly comprising the city of Forard. There is no spaceport control to direct them—the landing beacons have been extinguished for close to <strong>two years.</strong> Landing the ship is not difficult, since the terrain around the town is flat for hundreds of miles. However, if the ship was damaged during the “Seeing Red” encounter, the heroes should make a few <strong>Intelligence (PIloting) checks</strong> to land without incident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ship’s sensors detect only a few life forms in the vicinity. The planet’s atmosphere is cold and has a very high oxygen concentration. The air contains traces of toxins (such as methane and phosphorus), and a <strong>DC 15 Survival check </strong>reveals that the heroes should wear breath masks, at least while outside the ruins, to avoid being affected.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they ignore this warning or fail the <strong>Survival check,</strong> have the players make a <strong>DC 15 Constitution saving throw,</strong> if they fail they take <strong>[[/r 2d8[poison] # Poison damage]] damage</strong> and take one level of exhaustion from the toxic atmosphere. In addition, due to the large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere, players regain all their hit dice upon a long rest instead of only half.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The academy ruins are located in the city center, and since kaluthin doesn’t grow in the immediate vicinity, the heroes must use glowrods (or ignited lightsabers) to light the way. Heroes who are <strong>force sensitive </strong>automatically detect a strong presence of the dark side as soon as they get just over half a mile towards the academy. Due to the dark side interference, the Affect Mind, Mind Trick and <strong>Sense Emotion force</strong> <strong>powers</strong> do not function.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SQUIBS . . . WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE SQUIBS?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nearly circular city of Forard escaped the fate of the Jedi academy around which it was built. Citizens of the urban sprawl watched in horror and awe as fire rained down from the sky with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, utterly annihilating the academy. But if the people thought they were safe after this precision strike, they were dead wrong. With the destruction of the academy, a series of mysterious calamities befell the city, and now it remains all but lifeless.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whether the heroes land in this area as part of the encounter with the Red Fury Brotherhood or come to it afterward, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city is empty of men, women, and children. Hostile winds whip through the lifeless streets and between the alleyways of abandoned buildings. Unlike most of the planet, here the unchecked kaluthin has taken over, growing up to 6 feet tall in some parts of the city. And yet, the plant fails to mask strewn debris and the occasional decomposing body—the calling cards of looters and bandits who plundered the city after the unexpected attack almost <strong>two years ago.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you walk through the discarded remnants of old lives, you notice the empty twin buildings housing the local children’s school. To your left, you see faded graffiti on the wall, below a sign that reads “Remembrance Hall.” A collective chill runs down your spines as you make out suspiciously red letters that say, “DEATH TO THE UNFAITHFUL.\" When you get within a 300 feet of the academy ruins, you realize that all the kaluthin inside this radius has died off. This area is as dead as the entire planet was millennia ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a hero makes a successful<strong> DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> with <strong>disadvantage,</strong> they notice that they are being watched, though he can’t determine who or what is spying on them. He catches only shadows or overhears noises of jostled metal and debris. These are Sith worshippers and their Dark Lizard pets that, up until the bombardment, had relegated themselves to Almas’ Sith fortress and its immediate vicinity, where the lingering presence of the dark side used to be strongest. The heroes will encounter a pack of Dark Lizards before entering the Almas Academy and the Sith “Believers” later within the ruins’ obscured depths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes make their way to the city center, they reach the outer buildings that surround the Almas Academy—or what used to be the academy (see the map of the academy area on page 11). Extrapolated from the Coruscant Jedi Temple’s original design, only a few crumbling walls of the Jedi learning center are still visible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes near what might have been the entrance to the academy grounds, a cacophony of barely intelligible voices assails their ears. When the heroes get even closer, they spot three rotund beings in space suits towering over five aliens that look like rabid canines with blue fur. A member of each group is engaged in a tug-of-war over what looks like the upper half of a tarnished silver protocol droid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Ged your unholy pseudopoda off dis Holy Artifact, Zquib-thing,” the big one says.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The little guy retorts, “From our dead, cold paws, ugly Ugor fiend-being! We did the location finding of this silver-ish, prettisome treasure pre-secondary!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“It is unfortunate,” the half-droid says, “that Jedi Master Lanius never programmed me for a denouement of this particular design.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Hey, byu!” One of larger ones yells, popping off its helmet and turning part of its flabby amoebic body into an arm to wave you over “Hey byu, tell Zquib zinners we find dis Holy Artifact infinitely dimes infinitely before dem. Blease!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Scavengers. Given the scum that usually shows up in the wake of a battle or planetary catastrophe, these foragers seem relatively harmless. This should be evident to the heroes based on the exchanges they overhear. Based on the droid’s reference to his relationship with Jedi Master Lanius (whom <strong>Master Denia</strong> mentioned to the heroes), they should realize that the droid might have information that can help them with their mission. If the heroes do not catch on immediately, feel free to offer them other incentives to recover the droid for themselves, such as having the droid mention knowledge of the academy’s ruins (“This never would have happened if I’d stayed in the ruins!”) and so forth. When the heroes approach, all parties react with a degree of restrained but visible hope, each trying to share its side of the story before the others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SplrMuck, the unicellular Ugor holding the droid’s left arm, explains that his group found the droid first, fair and square, dragging it out from the Almas Academy ruins. SplrMuck set the droid down in front of the academy entrance for just a second when he saw the heroes’ ship set down nearby. SplrMuck’s story, if true, seems to be news to Jiminaldomabbramsti (or Jimi)—the feisty Squib with a death grip on the droid’s right arm—and his furry compatriots. They work for the Squib salvager Squeerie, and Jimi insists that no Ugors were around at the time he found this “treasure” near the temple entrance. Possession is ninehundred-and-ninety-nine one-thousandths of High Squibbian Law, so if SplrMuck set the droid down, for whatever reason, it’s fair game. By contrast, Ugors have turned garbage gathering into a religion, and Ugorian Divine Law decrees that the first being to find a piece of junk consecrates it with his slime on contact, a mark of ownership instantly identifiable and respected by any other Ugor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As for the half-droid himself, he explains respectfully that he is 7A39, or SevenAy, a former protocol droid for the Almas Academy. The heroes should not only feel inclined toward helping the hapless droid, but also recognize that SevenAy might have crucial information about the academy’s sublevels and perhaps the holocron they’re after.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have multiple challenges in their interactions with the scavengers, but only acquiring SevenAy or a special datacron is critical to the success of their mission. The heroes must negotiate with the Squib and Ugor parties for the droid. The following challenges show how the heroes can affect the outcome of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: The heroes must either save 7-A39 so that they can question the protocol droid or obtain a datacron that will grant access to the computer inside the academy's control room. Although the scavengers begin the encounter hostile toward each other, each group begins with an attitude of indifferent toward the heroes, whom they hope can solve their dilemma. As both groups are really less interested in SevenAy than in getting as many credits as they can, they are receptive to any deal the heroes try to spin in exchange for the droid. If pressed, SplrMuck will give up his claim to SevenAy for 2,000 credits, and Jimi will settle for any spare breath masks the heroes might have (the Squibs didn’t realize that the Almas atmosphere was technically poisonous). Once the heroes have acquired SevenAy, the Squibs throw in a net, free of charge, so that one of the heroes can carry the half-droid on his or her back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the characters don’t barter for SevenAy, the datacron can be used instead to splice into the academy’s computer. However, the datacron won’t offer the same advice that SevenAy can. The droid has intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the academy, even after the attacks, and can provide directions and explanations of how some systems inside the academy work—for example, that the backup generator can power only one sublevel at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: In addition to obtaining components for their ship, the heroes can haggle with the scavengers for other items. The Squibs have the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a battering ram</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a box of eight glowrods</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a beat-up children’s holobook of Busteromuchmacho and the Vermillion Shadow (Vol. 3 in the Squib Jedi series)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a broken lightsaber that belonged to Dorv'Tilsta, the Padawan of Master Vhiin’Thorla, which will be of use to the heroes later</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Ugors have these items:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a clone trooper utility belt (with a medpac and 50 ft of Fibercord cable)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a Stokhli spray stick (identifiable with a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a “holy holocron”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes show excitement over the holocron, the Ugors demand, in exchange, either a sizeable sum (5,000 credits) or something precious to the heroes. If the characters acquire the holocron, they quickly realize that it’s a “holocron” in name only—a cheap marketing ploy used to boost the appeal of everyday datacrons. If the Ugors allow the heroes to inspect the “holocron” before sealing the deal, a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (technology) check</strong> reveals that it is fake.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: Finally, the heroes should try to resolve the scavengers’ dispute peacefully, a successful <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check </strong>results in apologies from both sides for the misunderstanding. Give the players <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check</strong> if they attempt to get the Squib and Ugor parties to understand each other’s sacred laws. If the heroes anger one or both sides, they fail the challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-Hoc XP Award: If the heroes successfully resolve the Squib-Ugor dispute, award them XP as though they had defeated a CR 6 encounter</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STOTKLI SPRAY STICK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Weapon (electrostaff), prototype (requires attunement)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Originally created by the nomadic Stokhli species on the planet Manress, Stokhli spray sticks served as effective long-range stun weapons, and were first employed for big game hunting. These weapons had enough power to knock out large animals like gundarks, making them very popular among big-game hunters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You gain a <strong>+1 bonus</strong> to <strong>attack</strong> and <strong>damage rolls</strong> made with this weapon and this electrostaff's shocking DC increases from 13 to 15.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, this electrostaff comes with an integrated net launcher, the net launcher has a minimum range of 60ft and a maximum of 240ft, a reload of 5, and uses traditional power cells as ammunition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained and shocked until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a <strong>DC 13 Strength check</strong>, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 20 hit points, immunity to all <strong>damage</strong> not dealt by melee weapons, and <strong>resistance</strong> to <strong>damage</strong> dealt by unenhanced melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net’s effects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Squibs are small, furry humanoids with tufted ears. Their fur ranges from deep red to brilliant blue, and they have large yellow or red eyes. They are known for their fearless curiosity, shameless overconfidence, and love of haggling. They are enthusiastic scavengers, and often find fistfuls of credits in the detritus that others discard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ugors are single-celled beings. However, that single cell grows to be 6 feet across. An Ugor can extrude as many as thirty distinct pseudopodia, which serve as limbs, manipulators, or sensory organs. Ugors often have a “default” appearance, roughly humanoid, to deal with multicelled beings. Ugors see scavenging as their business and their religion. They are often selfish, unfriendly by nature, and concerned only with garbage and food. Lying and cheating are Ugor virtues, and they are highly competitive with Squibs, whom they consider their mortal enemies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SALVAGER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Squib or Ugor), lawful neutral</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (fiber armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 33 (6d8+6)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 14 (+2) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Investigation +4, Lore +4, Technology +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 10</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic and Squib or Ugor</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Techcasting.

The heroes’ only warning before the assault is a spine-chilling snarl and SplrMuck’s gurgling vociferation, “Holy irrebducible garbágina!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE BELIEVERS' PETS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the scavengers were receptive to the heroes before, they consider the heroes comrades now that they have shed dark side blood together. After killing the Dark Lizards, if the heroes had not already secured the items they wanted from the scavengers, the Squibs and Ugors turn them over with glee—at a meager 50 credits each. There’s nothing they wouldn’t do for a friend, after all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes have secured their prize (either the half-droid or the datacron), they can head directly into the Almas Academy ruins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTERING THE RUINS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do some reconnaissance outside, they can see that the ruins of eight rectangular buildings surround the tower like ragged teeth. The grounds between them and the main building used to be gardens, but are now littered with ferrocrete hunks of blasted wall and the remains of a military ship that crashed into the north side of the tower. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Soon, you pass the outer buildings and grounds that surround the academy proper. The remains of the circular structure are immediately identifiable as Coruscani in design. The majestic white marble tower lies toppled on the ground.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once you pass the yawning entrance, where the 16 foot-high double doors were ripped from their hinges by someone who valued only their material worth, you find yourselves in the entry hall. Even with all the surrounding devastation, the wonder of this place remains palpable. The few interior walls still standing are also made of white Selonian marble, lined with thick veins of silver that form into knots where wall and floor meet. Inlaid cases carved into the entry hall walls are set at about 3 feet off the floor. Dust-free spots inside them show that their contents were stolen rather recently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Only some sections of the ground floor remain accessible. Most of the corridors were blocked when the upper floors caved in during the bombardment. You must make your way over or under a row of once-dazzling columns at the hall center, now shattered into pathetic fragments. At the other end, past the cracked bust of a venerable Twi’lek Jedi, the only unobstructed path leads to the fountain chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once there, you find yourselves in a large, circular room, half of which is completely caved in. There are five marble benches lined up along the curving wall on the left and an exit at the other end, which leads to another dark corridor. While the farthest half is filled with debris, in the middle of the room sits a magnificent fountain. From its center extends an impressive sculpture of a large humanoid hand, palm out in a welcoming gesture. The work of art is cracked from the impacts it suffered during the <strong>attack.</strong> The fountain waters stopped bubbling a long time ago, and at the bottom of the dried-up pool is a dark, viscous substance that seems to slightly alter its shape. Must be a trick of the light. There seems to be nothing of interest in this former contemplation chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes go directly to the exit, skip to the next encounter. If at least one hero tries to touch the black substance, add the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you approach the black substance that lies at the center of the fountain, a tendril of ooze lashes out faster than the eye can see, and a profound cold engulfs you for a second. Before anyone realizes what has happened, the puddle of ooze disappears down the fountain water shaft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each hero in a square that is adjacent to the ooze is <strong>attacked</strong> by one tendril. The <strong>attack</strong> is considered a <strong>surprise attack</strong> and cannot act in response. Have any adjacent players make a <strong>DC 17 Dexterity saving throw</strong> and deals <strong>[[/r 1d8[psychic] # Psychic damage]] damage</strong>. The creature is a t’salak and will be encountered in the lower levels of the academy. It has been lying in wait as a sort of sentry, but it doesn’t use its <strong>powers</strong> on the heroes just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CAVE-IN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The right path on the ground floor is pretty clear-cut. The holomap contained within SevenAy or the datacron is useful only once the heroes reach the sublevels. Still, if the heroes ask, the droid reveals that the inaccessible rooms on the ground floor used to be offices and classrooms, the lightsaber training room, and the grand lecture hall. The only way downstairs is via an empty turbolift shaft located past the fountain chamber and to the left. But before they reach it, the heroes’ passing causes a wall to cave in—a wall that was sustaining the ceiling by a hairpin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The falling debris causes the players to make a<strong> DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong> deals <strong>[[/r 4d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> with a successful <strong>save</strong> taking<strong> half damage</strong>. Any hero who fails the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> gets caught beneath a lump of ferrocrete. A successful <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check </strong>will remove the debris.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes survive, they reach the turbolift shaft. It shows signs of recent activity, and heroes who make a <strong>DC 19 Wisdom (Survival) check </strong>will know that there were several humanoids who passed through here. If they succeed in a <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> they also know that it was only in the past <strong>few days</strong>. There are no handholds inside the shaft. To descend, the heroes must climb down or use an item such as a fibercord rope. The turbolift shaft descends for <strong>50 feet</strong> before reaching the first sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Note, surviving the cave in and entering the first sublevel of the Academy should be considered a level-up milestone.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: DOMAIN OF EVIL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the ruined ground floor above had at least some reflected light streaming in, the underground level is pitch black. As the heroes scurry down the empty shaft, they must rely on their own darkvision, glowrods, lightsabers or other sources of light to guide the way. Beneath the heroes is a rubble pile that fell inside the shaft, blocking the path north to the vehicle hangar, but the south exit out of the turbolift is clear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once outside the lift shaft, the heroes find themselves at the intersection of two corridors that form an “L” shape (see the map of sublevel 1). A thin coat of dust covers the floor, disturbed in places where several beings have recently traveled. The walls are constructed of reinforced white duraplast. The corridor going east leads to several small study chambers and the remains of a control room, before being blocked by a cave-in (see “Control Room,” below). The corridor going straight (south) has two blast doors (see “Generator Room,” below) and turns left about 75 feet down (see “Library,” below).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONTROL ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All meditation chambers (each about 10 feet wide by 25 feet long) are empty, so the main feature of this northern area is the control room. There is no power to this level, so the blast door must be opened manually. Heroes can jury-rig an external power source (such as a datapad or power cell) on a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. They can also pry open the door on a <strong>DC 20 Strength check </strong>or simply break it down (AC 15, 18 hit points). If the heroes enter the control room, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The blast door yields, and you find yourselves in a dark, dank room about 10 feet by 60 feet. On the opposite wall is a large, cracked transparisteel window with a view blocked by enormous boulders and slag. The far side of the room is also filled from floor to ceiling with rubble where the wall and window were not strong enough to hold back the collapsing academy structure. Below the window is a bank of consoles and computers; some have been damaged, with broken screens and severed wires hanging from underneath. But one console seems intact. It has a standard input for datapads and astromech droids.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes might have turned on the power to this level (see “Generator Room,” below). If not, they can power up the console with an external source on a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. If 7-A39 is with them, the droid suggests it to the heroes. If the <strong>check</strong> fails by <strong>5 or more</strong>, the console short-circuits and requires extensive repairs. If the <strong>check</strong> succeeds, the computer turns on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the Jedi had locked down the system with restricted access, so the heroes have to plug in either SevenAy (at his suggestion), the datacron they obtained from the Ugors or perform a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. The information that can be accessed includes a map of sublevel 1, descriptions of functions for each room (the most important of which is the library), and a dated log showing what vehicles were borrowed from the hangar (located behind the debris-blocked window) and by whom.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Access to the map shows a stairway leading down at the end of the corridor outside the control room, but the heroes noticed earlier that this route is blocked. They must circle the perimeter of the meditation rooms and arrive at the other side of the blocked passageway to access these stairs (unknown to the heroes, that stairway is also blocked by debris; see “Storage Rooms,\" below). The last log entry, dated around the same time as the attack on the Almas Academy, shows that all vehicles were evacuated from the hangar due to an emergency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To access information about the second sublevel, the heroes must succeed at a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. (See the map of sublevel 2 on page 19. Draw a version of the map that has no labels, and show it to the players.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can issue routine commands, such as turning on the power and opening unlocked blast doors, for either sublevel, but they can do so for only one sublevel at a time. If they turn on the power, the ceiling lights flicker on in the corridor outside. However, the lights are very dim and strobe unpredictably. Be sure to describe this phenomenon to unnerve the heroes as they move about the sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GENERATOR ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halfway across the corridor, on the west side wall, are two blast doors. If the heroes turned on the power in the control room, the doors whisk open with the push of a button. If not, they need to be powered up using an external source or forced (see “Control Room,” above). Behind both doors, the rooms are of equal size, roughly 20 feet by 50 feet at its largest points. The first room used to be a repair and maintenance area. Salvagers have picked it clean, but some pieces of junk are still lying around, including empty fuel containers, damaged repair tools, and all kinds of nuts, bolts, and hull plates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second room houses the academy’s power generator, a huge cylindrical turbine. Close inspection reveals that it is damaged beyond salvation. A smaller turbine nearby is the backup generator, and it is mostly intact. It can be powered on from the computer in the control room or by connecting a datapad directly to it and issuing the activation commands. The backup generator has only enough juice to power one level of the academy at a time, and since the top floors no longer exist, the heroes can use it to power one of the two sublevels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once activated, the backup generator will run for <strong>six hours</strong> before shutting down for a recharge. But the heroes won’t know this, so you can surprise them with this fact once the approximate time has lapsed (or at any particularly dramatic moment). The largely empty room also has a functioning repulsor sled, which the heroes can use to haul their gear around or as a battering ram to beat down doors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIBRARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The southern corridor parallels the one to the north, where the control room is located, except that it is not blocked by debris. This corridor is 110 feet long. Along its left (north) wall are numerous doors that lead to more meditation rooms, and in the center of the opposite (south) wall is a single door. The heroes can ignore the doors, swing left around the outside of the meditation chambers, and go directly toward the stairwell (see “Storage Rooms,\" page 14). Each meditation room is 10 feet by 25 feet and totally empty aside from a few personal effects, now caked with dust, that were left behind in a hurry. These inexpensive items (not worth more than 5 credits) might include a personal groomer, a planetary landscape holo-mag, and a recording rod loaded with relaxing music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most important area of sublevel 1 is the library, located directly across from the southern meditation rooms. The blast door to the library is locked, but it must be forced or powered on (see “Control Room,\" above) before a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong> can bypass the lock.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library is 40 foot by 40 foot room. If the heroes expect to find hints about the holocron that <strong>Master Denia</strong> sent them to retrieve, they will be greatly disappointed. Half the library has been blown away by blaster fire, while the rest has fallen victim to looters, Sith cultists, Almasians, and, finally, Inquisitor Valin Draco. Draco learned the specific hidden location of the Qornah Holocron from Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper and took the ancient teaching apparatus down to the deepest sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the Jedi library, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This library isn’t as large as its austere counterpart on Coruscant, but the ruination that greets you is no less dismaying. Even in dim light, you can make out a room that once was filled from floor to ceiling with shelves that housed hundreds of holobooks overflowing with Jedi wisdom. Now, the repository has been pulverized into dust by blaster fire, and the shelves rest toppled at precarious angles throughout the chamber, shattered against research stations and the marble floor. The shelves are kept company by overturned chairs and damaged computers spitting sparks. About 8 feet above you is an open second floor, where even more despoiled shelves, holobooks, and datacards lie. More bloodscrawled graffiti again attests to cultist desecration. The second floor has a catwalk that cannot be reached without a hoversled. Beneath the walkway ledge, at the eastern wall, a wooden door has been splintered open. Framing it are two bronzium busts, presumably of noble Jedi, one of them decapitated. A small plaque identifies the bust as Jedi Master Qornah. The head lies on the floor, severed in half. Oddly, the inside of the sculpture appears to have sheltered something cubical.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes inspect the bust of Master Qornah, they notice a hidden compartment that is in the shape of a cube 4 inches to a side—just the right size for a Jedi holocron, as described by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. At the time of the attack on the academy, the Jedi librarian was studying the Qornah Holocron and quickly tucked it away at the first sign of danger. The Sith holocron gatekeeper told Draco exactly where to find the Qornah Holocron, and the Inquisitor cleaved the bust and claimed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The splintered east door leads into a study where older documents were held. Unlike datacards, flimsiplast burns easily (even more so in Almas’ oxygen-rich atmosphere), so the destruction here is worse. The study also served as the analysis room, and destroyed computers sit on collapsed desks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Behind the west wall is another room, hidden behind a bookshelf, with no visible entrance. The heroes can determine the existence of the secret room by comparing the map (which combines the three rooms of the library into one large room with no walls or doors) to the size and shape of the actual room. The heroes might also notice the distance between the library door and either end of the corridor outside. A successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> reveals that a hidden room exists behind the west wall, but not how to gain entrance. A successful <strong>DC 20 Wisdom (Insight)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Insight) check</strong> to sense surroundings with the force reveals the entrance. Otherwise, a successful<strong> DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to search the wall—coupled with a lot of patience—reveals the mechanism that activates the shelf.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door has to be powered on or forced (see “Control Room,\" page 12). If the door is powered on, a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (security kit) check </strong>allows the heroes to bypass the lock. Failing the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5</strong> or more triggers a silent alarm, which alerts <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> on sublevel 2. Forcing the door automatically triggers the alarm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>QUOTH OF RIVAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes find a way inside the secret archive room, they stumble upon a grisly scene. Approximately a dozen corpses of different species, all in various states of decomposition, lie scattered about the room. A descending stairway is in plain view at the other end. When the heroes jury-rig the secret door, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the blast door whooshes open, the unmistakable odor hits you like a punch from a Barabel shockboxer: decaying flesh. Strewn before you are about twenty cadavers representing the gamut of alien anatomy and osteology, from Besalisk to Dug to Pinurquian. Judging from the death grip that the deceased have on their weapons, you surmise that two different parties met here a while ago, possibly to cut a deal or as rivals of some sort, and wound up wiping each other out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You spot the descending stairway on the other side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This stairway leads to the archives level below and was reserved exclusively for Jedi Masters. (There was a backup stairway access farther north that was sealed up like a bunker, but it is now blocked to the heroes, anyway). To reach it, the heroes must traverse the obstacle course of corpses. A successful <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, giving <strong>advantage</strong> if they inspect the room before enter, lets them notice motion sensors along the walls in the center of the room, a failsafe installed by the Imperials. If the heroes do not notice the sensors, they automatically trip them, and the blast door comes crashing down. See the 'Army of Darkness' section below if this occurs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While tiptoeing through the archive room, if the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>—perhaps to see what valuables or weapons the dead bodies possess—they notice a scrap of durasheet at the center of the north wall. If they try to get a closer look, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A cold breeze from the opened blast door behind you whips into the repository, sweeping up the burnt ashes of ancient Jedi texts. One item stands out, however. At a cursory glance, it appears to be nothing more than a scrap of durasheet, except that it seems to glow eerily. You head over to inspect it and find that it contains a solitary passage, written in a language you don’t understand. You lift the unexpectedly heavy fragment, and among the only laser-pen burned words written in a recognizable tongue are two defiled parts of a name: DA-TH R-V-N.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The scrap is all that’s left of a tome that belonged to the Sith Lord Darth Rivan. If the heroes have SevenAy with them, the droid can translate the text. It was referred to by Rivan as “the creed of ruin” and is written in Sith. SevenAy translates as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This appears to be a dead language. Yes, definitely—the Sith tongue is such a peculiar one. The passage appears to . . . oh my. Quite a bleak extract. It reads:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>‘There is no passion . . . there is solely obsession.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no knowledge. There is solely conviction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no purpose. There is solely will.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is nothing . . . Only me.’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If SevenAy translates this text, a deafening rumble, like that of a giant waking from its slumber, thunders through the surviving academy structure before a violent quake throws everything into chaos. In the library outside, shelves that were still standing shatter as they crash to the floor. The archive room's blast doors slam closed, casting the room into utter darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do not trip the sensors or read the text, proceed to sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARMY OF DARKNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes are inside the archive room when the doors shut, they participate in the following encounter. If any heroes are elsewhere at the time, they will not be able to get inside until the encounter is over. The heroes have triggered a trap involving powerful parasites that animate the corpses of the dead in this room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper convinced Draco to release a two <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> parasites in the library archive room, where their<strong> telekinetic powers</strong> seemingly bring the corpses to undead life. If any of the heroes fails a <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they are affected by the surprised condition as the encounter begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter the area, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An unexpected chill runs through your spine, and you hear moans coming from somewhere behind you. Impossibly, the cadavers that were littering the floor earlier are now shambling toward your group. One of them vaguely resembles a Kel Dor. Many of the corpses hold blaster pistols in bony hands that are blemished with chunks of spoiled flesh. You have to go through them to reach the stairs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GUARDIAN SPIRIT (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Called guardian spirits due to primitive cultures’ belief that they were the spirits of the dead come back to life, these creatures are actually parasites with telekinetic abilities. The two parasites can each inhabit one corpse at a time (the Guardian Spirit statblock), giving the body a semblance of undead animation. Simultaneously, each parasite can also reanimate up to two other corpses without actually being in their bodies (the Animated Coprse statblock), but they do so less efficiently, and only to help kill the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The parasites cannot live outside of a host body for long. If the heroes kill a host body, its parasite inhabits one of the remaining animated corpses, turning it into a guardian spirit. If there are no animated corpses close enough to inhabit, the parasite has nowhere to go and is destroyed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These cadavers are actually made up of two distinct groups: the salvagers known as the Stalfonauts and bounty hunters led by the Kel Dor Jacen Yar, who had been out to capture Jedi survivors of the orbital bombardment. The two parties ran into each other in the academy library and wound up killing each other in the archive room. Now, controlled by the parasites like string puppets, their skeletal remains remember nothing of their former lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You’re surrounded by the approaching corpses. Along with their putrefied organic remains, the dark side drips from the reanimated cadavers like saliva from a predatory nexu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dancing light fills the cavernous eye sockets of their decomposing general as the Kel Dor corpse levels its blaster pistol at you.

If no corpses are within range the spirit dies permanently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Innate Forcecasting. The spirit's forcecasting ability is Charisma (power save DC 13, +5 to hit with force attacks).

If damage reduces the spirit to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is energy or from a critical hit.

They flank the heroes, using the help action if necessary to guarantee hits on slippery targets.

If there are none within 30 feet, the parasites dissipate with a dying howl. Heroes need only wait a moment until the blast doors open to have easy access to the stairway leading down to sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library archive room contains shelves along the walls, a few desks in the middle, and a large table on the north side (where Rivan’s document is resting).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the heroes neutralize the infected corpses, they can proceed down the staircase. If some heroes were trapped outside the archive room during the encounter, the blast door becomes unlocked <strong>10 minutes</strong> after the sensors were tripped. The stairway leads to the second sublevel of the Almas Academy. Once the heroes descend the stairs, proceed to sublevel 2, below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STORAGE ROOMS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the end of the corridor, past the meditation rooms and library, the heroes can turn left. At the other (north) end of this corridor, another cave-in blocks the utility staircase leading down, which the heroes might have seen on the map or learned about from SevenAy. Unfortunately, unless they want to spend a lot of time digging through the rocks (It would take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong> of hard labor), the utility staircase is not accessible. The heroes might give up or look for another way down (see “Library,\" above).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the corridor, halfway to the utility stairway, are two blast doors. They are unlocked but need to be powered on (see “Control Room,\" above). The first room was a storage space for supplies— anything other than food that was needed by a small, self-contained community such as the Almas Academy. This room was heavily pillaged by thieves and salvagers, who left little behind but empty containers. Describe various containers of soap and torn articles of clothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they also notice two surprisingly light, tiny strongboxes with each strongbox is 8 cubic inches in size, can fit in the palm of most people's hands and are made of smooth, black iron. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> reveals that the containers are made of Mandalorian iron, which was believed to be impenetrable by the <strong>Force.</strong> If the <strong>check</strong> beats the <strong>check</strong> by an additional <strong>5</strong>, the heroes also know that the claim is false— the iron cannot stop the <strong>Force,</strong> but the strong alloy is resistant to many types of energy. The boxes have a very strong lock, equivalent to an ultrahigh security lock and opening them requires a <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second room is where the Jedi received and kept their food supplies. Most food has been stolen; the rest spoiled long ago. In the southwest corner of the room is a small kitchen where the residents prepared meals and processed foods. Describe some unidentifiable blackened mounds of rubbish, leftover kitchen appliances, a heating unit, a broken-down refrigeration unit, various utensils, and small spice containers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUBLEVEL 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This sublevel can be reached only via the staircase in the library’s secret archive room. The other staircase down is blocked (see “Storage Rooms,” above). Upon reaching this area, the heroes immediately feel a deep unease that tempts them to turn back. <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> heroes must make a <strong>DC 15 Charisma saving throw</strong> or suffer the effects of the <strong>Curse force power </strong>when using Light aligned <strong>force powers</strong>. The effect lasts as long as they are on this sublevel. Expending <strong>2 force points</strong> or a <strong>1st level force slot</strong> will negate this effect. Also, the Force Sight and<strong> Sense Force force powers</strong> do not function within range of the dark side nexus that has developed here due to Rivan’s lasting influence. Species that rely on the <strong>force</strong> to see such as Miraluka are unaffected by the dark side interference for the purposes of vision.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Encounters are labeled on the map but don’t have to be followed in the sequence presented. The encounters marked “Crazed Believers” and \"Dreambeast\" can happen in any number of rooms at your discretion. You can decide that all unused rooms are empty or permanently locked, or you can detail them as you wish (see the note block below for suggestions).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUBLEVEL 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevel 2 contains a number of rooms that are not described in this adventure. You can choose to have them empty or locked, or you can detail them as desired. Use the following as quick examples:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Surgical Bay: The walls are sterile white. The room reeks of bleach and, faintly, mildew. A half-dozen tables clutter the center. Optionally, a blast door leads to a smaller nursery room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Research Laboratory: Here, countertops and transparisteel cabinets contain various instruments and decayed samples of vegetation (such as lichens, fungi, kaluthin, and so on).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meeting Room: This room contains several chairs and a large oval table with a broken holoprojector on top. Jedi Masters held important meetings here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WEAPONS ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This room was visited recently, but the blast door controls were destroyed. Opening the door requires <strong>1 hour</strong> and a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes take the time to repair the door and open it, they find something surprising: a blaster shooting range. After all, lightsaber wielding Jedi have to practice their shooting skills, too. If the sublevel has power, several holographic targets appear when the heroes enter the room, startling them. There are representations of Gungans, Jawas, Squibs, and various small beasts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another blast door leads to a back room. If the heroes have not restored power and unlocked the doors to sublevel 2, they must open the blast door manually (see “Control Room,\" above). If they do so, they find that the back room is an armory. Transparent plexi on the ground shields a small stream that runs along just under floor level. This room has 7 usable blaster pistols and 20 power cells. Everything else has either been stolen or rusted beyond use.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REFRESHER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a fairly standard washroom for both men and women. It contains effluvial rinsers as well as refreshers. Along the floor runs a narrow natural stream, covered by transparent plexi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CRAZED BELIEVERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the west arch leading to the underground park, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the first of many crazed Humans who wander this level, looking for blood. Feel free to run this encounter more than once in any of the labeled rooms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: The heroes must defeat the Believers cultists, who have fallen under the influence of the nearby t’salak. Most cultists have killed each other already, but the few remaining groups (as many as needed, in your judgment) wander about and <strong>attack</strong> the heroes on sight. They have been exposed to the t’salak’s touch so many times that the rage it induces is effectively a form of permanent madness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: The heroes might try to subdue one or more Believers without killing them. They can accomplish this by grappling them and tying them up, stunning them with blasters, or rendering them unconscious. However, this doesn’t cure their madness, and as soon as they recover, the Believers will <strong>attack</strong> again. They must be alleviated of their delirium to be of any use. To do this, the heroes must make a DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) to have the followers calm down.

Some of them might carry ID cards, datapads, or other personal items tucked in the pockets of their dirty and ripped vests. They carry whatever weapons they were able to find in their mindless wanderings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of Sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Believers can be encountered in several different rooms around the sublevel. Refer to the sublevel 2 section of the adventure and the accompanying map for descriptions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>UNDERGROUND PARK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All water on Almas is underground, so the academy’s Jedi custodians reasoned that building an underground park with a running stream would be in tune with the will of the <strong>Force.</strong> The stream was discovered while digging the academy foundations. Instead of diverting it, the Jedi requested that the architects integrate the stream into the design—it was they who had intruded on the water’s natural course, after all. The Jedi then planted local trees and kaluthin and created a garden around the stream. Occasionally, they took blind coboko fish out of the pond that formed in the park center, adding them to the academy menu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of course, all the park vegetation is now dead, blackened by the intense presence of the dark side. The park also contains several bodies of Believers who managed to find the secret stairwell in the library and turned viciously on one another after encountering the t’salak. At the center of the room, beside the pool, is a large pump used to force water to the levels above. It looks like it hasn’t functioned in a long time. The heroes don’t have much time to admire the scenery, however. When they reach the park center, read the following text:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You walk into the impressive chamber, crossing a bridge than runs over a clear and soothing stream. To your left is a large pond, beyond which is an artistic elevation made of simple mud and rock. Disharmoniously, dead vegetation and dead bodies surround it all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you take in your surroundings, your companions suddenly disappear from view, and you are alone. Solid walls seem to have materialized out of nowhere and separated all of you, at the same time blocking the entrance from which you came. You feel a deep sense of dread when a cruel figure from your past appears right in front of you—someone you never imagined you would see again. You look around for a way out, but your feet don’t respond. You try to cry out, but the attempt yields no sound. As if in slow motion, the heartless figure prepares to <strong>attack.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter is similar to Luke’s experience inside the cave on Dagobah. Each hero finds him- or herself face to face with his or her worst nightmare. The heroes are caught in a combination of a mind trick (which makes them believe that they cannot walk away or speak out) and a <strong>Force illusion</strong> (which makes them believe that they are facing an old enemy).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For each hero, choose a character or creature that poses a threat and has some significance to that hero. It could be an enemy, living or dead, from a previous adventure or even from the current adventure. It could also be someone from the hero’s past (for instance, an unlikable former employer or a cruel family member). Determine the appropriate encounter for each hero in advance, without worrying about statistics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The effects of the dark side nexus permeating this place, in combination with the influence of the t’salak (which feeds on the heroes’ feelings of hate and fear), create this <strong>Force illusion</strong>. Heroes who make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> realize that their enemy is an illusion, but this knowledge does not dispel the illusion. The twist is that behind each “illusion” hides one of the other heroes. The trap is designed to cause the heroes to fight each other unknowingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Prior to the adventure, ask the players for their character sheets, and record their most important scores (<strong>weapon damage dice</strong>, <strong>attack bonuses</strong> and types, defenses, hit points, <strong>Initiative</strong> and skills, and so on). Then, when each hero faces an illusion, describe what weapons or items the opponent carries—in other words, the weapons or items used by the other hero. There is no need for an illusion to wield the same exact weapon as the hero behind it, but the weapon should resemble something in the same class (such as a vibrosword, blaster, lightsaber, and so on).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the number of heroes is uneven, one of the heroes is met by a crazed Believer instead of by another hero (for statistics, see “Crazed Believers,”). In this case, the Believer hides behind the illusion of a friend, such as <strong>Senator Organa, Master Denia</strong>, or even one of the other heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Explain to the heroes that they are all inexplicably isolated from one another. Ask for <strong>initiative</strong> rolls, and record the results beside each hero’s name. As soon as an <strong>attack</strong> occurs, use player who is opposite them as a target. If the <strong>attack</strong> hits and <strong>damage</strong> is dealt, record the number. Pretend that the next <strong>initiative</strong> turn belongs to the opponent of the hero just <strong>attacked,</strong> describe the <strong>attack,</strong> and reveal the <strong>damage</strong> dealt. If one hero is fighting a Believer, this fight can be incorporated with the others in order of <strong>initiative</strong> but treated as regular combat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Allow each character a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> at the beginning of their turn to realize that something is not right. Success indicates that the hero can tell that what he sees before him is not real, though it looks as if it could become real at any moment. If a matched pair of heroes goes for <strong>3 consecutive rounds</strong> without <strong>attacking</strong> each other, the entire illusion is dispelled for the whole group, and the angry t’salak <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER EXAMPLE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how this encounter could be run. Assume that the party contains five heroes, so four of the heroes fight each other, while the fifth fights a Believer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vor’en the soldier (Init 20) versus Arani the noble (Init 14)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kelko the scout (Init 16) versus Sia-Lan the Jedi (Init 28)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Deel the scoundrel (Init 24) versus a Believer (Init 8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 1</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sia-Lan is up first, and she‘s face to face with Count Dooku. But Sia-Lan makes her <strong>Perception check</strong> and knows that Dooku is dead, so she realizes that the encounter must be a trick. She decides<strong> not to attack.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Deel finds himself facing one of his friends, Kelko, who runs madly toward him. Deel asks him what is going on, but his voice is mysteriously soundless. He fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and doesn’t realize that it's a trick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Vor’en fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and thinks that he’s run into a <strong>stormtrooper.</strong> He pulls out a blaster and fires at the enemy, striking Arani and dealing 8 points of energy <strong>damage.</strong> (From Arani’s perspective, she’s shot by an old friend, who wields a hold-out blaster that she gave him long ago.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Kelko (who also failed his <strong>Perception check</strong>) takes out his two vibrodaggers to <strong>attack</strong> a green, tentacled alien that he once encountered on Zlarbv IV. He slashes at it, dealing <strong>12 points</strong> of <strong>kinetic damage</strong> to Sia-Lan. (From Sia-Lan’s perspective, Count Dooku <strong>attacks</strong> her with two lightsabers. The Jedi doesn’t understand what’s happening—she was sure that the appearance of Dooku was some kind of trick!)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Arani succeeds on her <strong>Perception check</strong> and tries to convince the phantom that she is no threat, but he doesn’t seem to hear her. She has to defend herself, so she pulls out her own blaster and shoots him, dealing <strong>12 points of energy damage.</strong> (From Vor’en’s perspective, he’s shot by the <strong>stormtrooper.)</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, the Believer acts, rushing Deel and pummeling him to the ground, dealing <strong>15 points of kinetic damage.</strong> (From Deel’s perspective, he’s being <strong>attacked</strong> by his friend Kelko. Has he gone crazy? Regardless, Deel decides that he must defend himself.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sia-Lan can’t believe it. Count Dooku just <strong>attacked</strong> and nearly killed her. Maybe “Dooku” is a clone, a doppelganger, or something else, but whatever it is, Sia-Lan was hurt for real and must defend herself. She ignites her lightsaber, preparing to <strong>attack</strong> Kelko . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OOZING MADNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can enter the underground park via one of two arches. The t’salak is hiding behind the pond on an elevated slope at the room’s northern side. The heroes must cross the pond to get to the creature, or shoot it from a distance (which is a much wiser option).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Evil. That's the first word that comes to mind as you look at the featureless pool of black ooze. Suddenly, a tendril snaps at you, <strong>attacking</strong> from the creature’s central mass, almost too fast to see. You barely avoid it, but as you dodge, the creature tracks you move for move. It seems filled with hate and bent on pure destruction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A <strong>Force-sensitive </strong>creature of unknown origin, the t’salak is an oozing, black mound of evil. A specimen was first encountered in the jungles of Cularin and subsequently imprisoned inside a <strong>Force-imbued </strong>urn. The urn was buried inside a cave and guarded by a Tarasin village for generations, until recently stolen by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun. With the help of scientists, Raik discovered a way to divide the t’salak into independent entities of equal power. It is unknown how many more specimens remain in existence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak has no sensory organs but leaves no question as to its strength and cunning; it lashes out with sticky tendrils that have surprising accuracy and power. Filled with chaotic thoughts born of malignity, the t’salak can induce a blinding rage in its targets just by touching them, permeating their souls with darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak moves toward the heroes and tries to hit them with its tendrils to induce rage in them. The creature hopes that the heroes will be too distracted by killing each other to <strong>attack</strong> it, so that it can go back to its hiding place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak cannot be killed by solid objects, but it can be wounded and is highly susceptible to cold and vacuum. Unless the t’salak is trapped within a container imbued by the <strong>Force</strong> or made of Beskar or finally in a cold vacuum while it is inert (0 hit points), it regenerates itself and <strong>attacks</strong> anew.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium aberration, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (natural armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 170 (20d8+80)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft., climb 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 16 (+3) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +8, Con +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities Cold</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy and kinetic damage from weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Exhaustion, Frightened, Poison, Prone</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses Blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (3,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Induce Raging Madness. When the t'salak deals damage to a creature from a <strong>melee attack,</strong> the creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must make at least one <strong>attack</strong> against the closest ally on its turn. The creature repeats this save on the end of its turn with a successful save removing this effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regeneration. The t'salak regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. When reduced to 0 hitpoints, the t'salak becomes an inert puddle for <strong>5 minutes</strong> and then after <strong>10 minutes</strong> it returns to maximum health unless it is contained inside a container made of beskar, a container that is is <strong>force imbued</strong> or exposed to a vacuum.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tendril.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The t'salak regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tendril. The t'salak makes one attack with its tendrils.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The lake in the middle of the room is an obstacle to the heroes as it counts as difficult terrain. Once across, they can climb the slope on the other side. To reach the area where the t’salak is hiding from across either stream area, the heroes must climb up the 7 foot high muddy hillock that forms the north shore of the pool. It is slippery, requiring a successful <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>. There are some slim trees scattered about the gardens, but they provide very little cover or concealment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THERE'S SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT THIS PLACE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter one of the rooms labeled “Dreambeast” (your choice), an extreme cold envelops them. The heroes immediately fall into a profound sleep without realizing it. Read the following text:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you enter the room, your vision fogs momentarily. You shake your head vigorously and feel slightly dizzy. You blink your eyes in rapid succession, then scour your surroundings suspiciously, looking for anything amiss. But everything seems normal. Your friends are all here, and you feel fine now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Still, there is something familiar about this place . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The room is an illusion, a trap devised by the Sith holocron gatekeeper and created by Inquisitor Draco. As the heroes proceed through the sublevel toward the nexus of evil, they are unwittingly immersing themselves more and more fully within Rivan’s aura of influence. This is doubly true now that the holocron gatekeeper of the Dark Lord has found a cohort in the Inquisitor, augmenting <strong>Draco’s powers</strong> significantly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wherever this encounter plays out, the sleeping heroes discover that the room looks identical to one they’ve previously visited. If they attempt to exit the room, they stumble into another familiar area of the academy, but not one normally connected to the room they are leaving, creating a disorienting effect. You should try to create the claustrophobia of a recurring nightmare from which the heroes cannot seem to wake. To drive the point home, you can repeat descriptions of academy chambers that the heroes have visited already. Each time, preface the description with one of the following three phrases (preferably in this order):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There’s something’s not right here . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There’s something familiar about this place . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You’ve got a very bad feeling about this . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The longer their minds remain under <strong>Draco’s power</strong>, the more despair eats away at their confidence and motivation. For every encounter that the heroes relive in the dreamscape, their “dream persona” gains one level of exhaustion. However, the heroes can have a maximum of three encounters in the dreamscape. During each encounter, the heroes have a chance to break free of the illusion. With their minds playing tricks on them, they need to overcome their own senses; each hero can make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</strong> once per faux-encounter. If they succeed, they wake up, preventing Draco from further sapping their moral strength. Otherwise, after the third encounter, the heroes awaken regardless, though their exhaustion is persistent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any hero avoids Draco’s trap entirely—that is, if a hero does not enter the room at all—she does not enter the dreamscape. Instead, she realizes that she nearly fell to a dark side trick and can see her friends lying unconscious in the room. Heroes caught in the dreamscape take note of the “missing” party members, and their interaction with them is limited.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any hero who avoided Draco’s trap sees her sleeping friends writhe and groan in mental anguish. She can’t shake them awake, but once per dreamscape encounter, she can try to communicate with them. However, her words will be distorted. The dreamer should be baffled by the gibberish, but a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong> deciphers the words. If that occurs, the hero can make the <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> to realize that he is trapped in a dream state and escape immediately. If the hero fails the <strong>saving throw</strong>, he goes on to have another déjà vu experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless of the manner by which the heroes awaken, immediately thereafter, they must battle a fearsome k’kayeh dreambeast that has anchored itself to the heroes and pursued them into the waking world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes defeat the k’kayeh dreambeast and its spawn, it disappears as if it never existed. A true k’kayeh will make a stunning appearance at the end of the adventure, but for now, heroes can continue exploring the area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE DREAMS BEASTS ARE MADE OF</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though the heroes have snapped out of their dream daze, they are still under Draco’s influence and come face to face with an enormous dark side apparition.

Double the size of even the biggest bull rancor, the reptilian colossus drags its golden body into the chamber, scales shifting along its hide like impenetrable plates of anvilstone.

A <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> abomination, this Sithspawn’s sandy scales match the color of Almas’ desert wasteland and are as tough as armor plating. The serpentine creature is also amphibious, as comfortable in open air as swimming in the planet’s hidden underground lakes. The k’kayeh’s maw is a steely-toothed deathtrap, and its claws are eviscerating razors. As if that weren’t enough, instead of breathing fire, this dark side abomination can shoot<strong> Force lightning </strong>from each nostril of its monstrous snout.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This “dreambeast” is only a tenth the size of the truly gigantic k’kayeh that lurks in the depths of the Almas Academy, but it is still enormous. Similar to Sith dopplegangers, this k’kayeh dreambeast is an illusory clone of the actual living entity, spawned by Inquisitor Draco under the guidance of Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper.

It then makes three attacks: one with its claws, and two with its bite. It can use its devour instead of its bite.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 15 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage. If the target is large or smaller, the target is now grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the K'kayeh Dreambeast can't bite another target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The K’kayeh Dreambeast exhales force lightning in a 90 foot cone. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Devour. The K’kayeh Dreambeast makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the K’kayeh Dreambeast, and it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the K’kayeh Dreambeast's turns. If the K’kayeh Dreambeast takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the K’kayeh Dreambeast must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the K’kayeh Dreambeast. If the K’kayeh Dreambeast dies, a swallowed creature appears within a space that the K'kayeh Dreambeast occupied as K'kayeh Dreambeast's body vanishes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Frightful Roar. Each creature of the K’kayeh Dreambeast's choice within 90 feet of it must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for <strong>1 minute</strong>. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the K’kayeh Dreambeast is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the K’kayeh Dreambeast's Frightful Roar for the next <strong>24 hours</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most disturbing thing about the beast is its snout. Sure, you’ve read the fairy tales about fire-breathing monsters. You may even have fought a dragon-slug on Corulag. But as you watch dark side lightning dance wickedly from one of the creature’s mammoth nostrils to the other, you know only one thing for certain . . . you’re in trouble.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>K'KAYEH DREAMBEAST TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The k’kayeh dreambeast has many weapons at its disposal. Besides its teeth and claws, it uses its<strong> force lightning</strong> breath when avaliable to hit as many heroes as possible. Any cover in the room can be crushed (or appear to be crushed) by the enormous beast. Any hero grabbed by the creature winds up in its mouth to be consumed, taking <strong>damage</strong> from its arm-length teeth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIVING NIGHTMARE (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Living nightmares are manifestations of <strong>Force energy</strong> that appear in shifting, horrific forms.

If they pass the room without entering it, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the nighthunter that guards Thorla. The blast door is open, and the Twi’lek Jedi Master’s <strong>powers</strong> are kept in <strong>check</strong> inside a Universal Energy Cage designed to contain<strong> Force-users</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DRACO'S BEST FRIEND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are <strong>attacked</strong> in the corridors outside the prison room.

But your <strong>attacker</strong> is no Sith. Crouched in front of you are 7 hulking feet of quadrupedal, ravenous instinct. The crimson predator is a nighthunter, believed to be as extinct as the Jedi. You consider that the creature might be a good omen in a way—that is, until it bellows a spine-tingling howl.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIGHTHUNTER (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s the blood-red, blaster-resistant hide. Maybe it’s the claws, which are nearly as long as the fangs protruding up to its eyes and down to its chin. Or maybe it’s the fact that these creatures ambush their prey using the <strong>Force.</strong> Whatever it is, nighthunters give even Jedi pause. Xenobiologists believe that nighthunters are a mutant offshoot of another species, with Myrkr’s vornskrs ranking high on the list due to their whiplike tails, <strong>Force-sensitivity,</strong> and variety of subspecies. Some contend that nighthunters inspired the hellhounds of Corellian myth. No one really knows.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>Force-using</strong> predators have been hunted almost to extinction, but the one guarding Master Thorla shares a peculiar history with Inquisitor Draco. The creature hunted an injured Draco in the aftermath of the Battle of Parein II 4, and they nearly killed each other. However, after wounding the nighthunter, Draco nurtured it back to health, and the beast bonded to its savior. Draco kept the animal and gave it the name Crant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The creature’s hide looks blaster resistant. Its huge anterior claws rake at the floor in tandem with those of its hind paws, grinding out a symphony that hurts your ears and chills your blood. Five immense fangs jut out and over both of its lips, almost concealing its face, except for its two tiny, hungry eyes. As you watch its whiplike tail dancing like a vine snake about to strike, you realize that in this confined space, the beast has a good chance of ripping you into bite-sized chunks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIGHTHUNTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium beast, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 72 (13d8+13)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14 (+2) 18 (+4) 12 (+1) 3 (-4) 12 (+1) 6 (-2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Perception +4, Stealth +10, Survival +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy, fire</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 5 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Sensitive.

The beast circles around, uses <strong>force camouflage </strong>and stealthily comes back from another direction, perhaps <strong>several rounds later</strong>. You can create tension by having the heroes make <strong>Perception checks</strong> if they are not searching for the nighthunter. They might think it’s gone and proceed with their exploration, only to be <strong>attacked</strong> in a different area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After defeating the beast, the heroes can enter the room it guarded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use the corridors around the <strong>prison room.</strong> If the heroes find refuge inside a room and lock it, they prevent the creature from <strong>attacking.</strong> But they must come out eventually, and the nighthunter is very patient. The room in which Master Thorla is detained doesn’t have a working blast door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Having dealt with the Nighthunter, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door is completely open. In fact, burn damage all along the 12 foot-wide entrance appears to have enlarged it. A pulsating glow within lights up the darkened room. Inside, you find a spherical energy cage floating on repulsorlifts. The glow comes from a force field that surrounds the portable <strong>prison,</strong> and behind the bars lies a crumpled humanoid form.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The man, a Twi’lek, meets your gaze with a look of utter despair. Instead of exhibiting hope at the sight of potential rescuers, he quickly looks away, as if to say, “Leave me alone.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This room also contains a thick plasteel table, with traces of a black substance on it and a Jedi robe sprawled across it. Master Thorla is in very bad shape, both physically and mentally. His body is emaciated, and he sports several burns and cuts. To run this dramatic encounter, you must understand the Jedi’s backstory (see the sidebar on page 18). The heroes might suspect that the prisoner is a Jedi and decide to free him. If they interrogate him, Thorla tells them to leave him alone and that he is beyond redemption.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Universal Energy Cage was designed specifically to contain a <strong>Force-user’s powers</strong>. Prisoners in the cage can, however, use the <strong>Force</strong> at very low levels, such as casting cantrips. The cage’s functions are controlled by a handheld remote that is currently in Draco’s possession. The cage has no visible controls, and the only way to open it is to destroy it, which endangers the life of the prisoner within. The Universal Energy Cage has a <strong>damage threshold</strong> of <strong>10</strong> and 55 (5d10) hit points. The cage is also built with a contact shock field, and every time the cage receives <strong>damage</strong> from an <strong>attack</strong> that deals <strong>25 damage</strong> or more, the Jedi inside receives a nonlethal shock that deals <strong>9 ([[/r 2d8[lightning] # Lightning damage]])  damage</strong>, this effect also occurs when an <strong>attack</strong> would automatically miss. When this happens, Thorla yelps in pain, but does not otherwise react.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the Jedi is free, whether he is conscious or not, the heroes notice that his skin is charred in multiple places, showing that he has suffered many shocks. He has four levels of exhaustion, which can only be removed by receiving extensive, long-term medical and psychological care. If Thorla is conscious, he does not run away or try to escape, but he won’t answer the heroes’ questions, either, wanting only to be left alone. He’s been fighting off Draco’s attempts at turning him to the dark side and has fallen into despair. Since the loss of his Padawan, Thorla has become disconsolate, and any mention of Jedi or Imperials angers him. He has an unfriendly attitude and if the heroes physically push or restrain him, he becomes violent and <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter is a chance for heroes with investment in <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> to be very useful. With some good roleplaying and a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, Thorla might be coaxed into revealing that he was a Jedi, but that he no longer has the will to go on. If the player beats a <strong>DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> instead, Thorla will become friendly and additionally answer questions about his captors. An alternative way to convince Thorla to talk is to show Thorla his Padawan’s broken lightsaber (if the heroes obtained it from the Squibs).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thorla can provide the following information:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He knows Inquisitor Draco and Raik Muun, and he suspects that they are inside the archives room in the southwest corner of the sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If asked about a holocron, he reveals that indeed the Inquisitor has one in his possession.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thorla refuses to accompany the heroes willingly. He says that all the Jedi are dead and there is no reason to go on—not with sadistic torturers like Draco running the galaxy. If told of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, the Twi’lek says he’s never heard of her, and besides, one more Jedi won’t make any difference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In any case, when the heroes realize that the broken Jedi will not budge, they should move on. As long as the heroes leave Thorla alive, he might appear again later in the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VHIIN’THORLA, SURVIVOR OF ORDER 66</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A green-skinned Twi'lek, Vhiin'Thorla studied at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he befriended fellow student Devan For'deschel. Thorla eventually became a Jedi Master and a skilled duelist, participating in many missions. One of these missions changed his life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>About a <strong>year before</strong> the Clone Wars sparked, he and his Padawan Kritz Drassarb were sent to investigate a band of pirates in the Mid Rim. After <strong>two months</strong>, the ruthless organization was dismantled, but at the cost of Kritz’s life. Thorla blamed himself for his student’s death and exiled himself to his homeworld of Ryloth. He sought solitude in the planet's badlands but soon found a new purpose.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A<strong> few months</strong> into the Clone Wars, Master Devan sent envoys to Ryloth to invite her old friend to join her at the Almas Academy as the new Master of Lightsabers. When the envoys finally found Thorla, they discovered that he had spent the <strong>last year</strong> rescuing Twi'lek prisoners from slavers and had formed a community called the Enclave. Thorla had also taken on a new Padawan, a young Lethan Twi’lek named Dorv'Tilsta. Witnessing all the good that Master Thorla was accomplishing, the envoys respected his decision to decline Master Devan’s offer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Increasing slaver <strong>attacks</strong> forced Thorla to delay a visit to the Almas Academy. Then Order 66 came. Thorla felt the death of his fellow Jedi through the <strong>Force</strong> and moved the Enclave to a more secure location, but after <strong>two long years,</strong> he risked exposure to learn more about the current state of the galaxy. Repulsed by what he discovered, he decided to investigate the fate of his old friend Devan on Almas, taking his <strong>10-year-old</strong> Padawan with him. What he found was a demolished academy at the heart of a ghost town. He probed the ruins, winding his way down to the deepest sublevel, where he knew the secured archives were located.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fate was not on Thorla’s side. Inquisitor Draco and his retinue arrived shortly thereafter, and a fierce lightsaber duel ensued. However, Draco’s Dark Jedi lapdog Raik Muun held Thorla's inexperienced Padawan hostage and induced a murderous rage into young Dorv with her evil t'salak, forcing him to <strong>attack</strong> his own master. A tortured Thorla fended off his Padawan, while Draco threatened to turn the boy to the dark side if Thorla refused to fight. Remorsefully, Thorla finally severed Dorv from life and misery. At that moment, the Twi'lek master snapped and fell to the dark side, racked with guilt over losing another Padawan. He desired to die, but the Imperials denied him this wish. He’s been held in a Universal Energy Cage ever since, meditating on how he lost his way as a Jedi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: DRACO'S LAIR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes descend into the depths of the Jedi academy, they draw closer to the nexus of dark power surrounding Inquisitor Draco. You should emphasize the growing sense of dread the heroes feel, including a strong sense of danger for any <strong>force sensitive</strong> players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARCHIVES ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes reach the archives room (whether they found it themselves or were informed by SevenAy or Master Thorla), they find the door tightly shut. They can open the door by following the procedures described in “Control Room” from the first sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes enter the archives room, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You find yourselves in a long room, 45 feet wide by 80 feet long, with the chamber forking to the right about 30 feet in. Leaning against the smooth walls are cases containing fascinating and rare artifacts and weapons that were of interest to the Jedi. It is surprising that most of them seem untouched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most glaring features of the room are the far wall and floor, which have crumbled away to reveal a cavernous opening that leads into a dark tunnel. This obviously wasn’t part of the room’s original design and seems to be a consequence of the orbital bombardment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This chamber was forbidden to Padawans. It was where the Jedi Masters kept their most precious <strong>Force</strong> artifacts, including the holocron the heroes seek (until it was hidden in the bust of Master Qornah). It also contains the entrance to the underground caves where Draco is consulting with the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan. To keep intruders from interrupting his studies, Draco left behind some of the deadliest henchbeings in the galaxy to guard the cave entrance. Several creatures await the heroes here, as motionless as statues in their hiding places among the shadows. Masters of stealth, these steely, grayskinned warriors are all but undetectable in the dim light.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If players decide to investigate the room they will discover that information that relates to Inquisitor Draco and Darth Rivan's Holocron, specifically that Sith holocrons can sometimes bond to a <strong>force user</strong> granting them additional power. It is possible to disrupt this connection by the use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes enter the archives room, have them roll <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> against the creatures’ <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) checks</strong>, with <strong>disadvantage</strong> unless they have some form of light. If the heroes succeed, one of their light sources or pure chance illuminates what appears to be a five foot-high statue resembling a gargoyle in one of the corners. This is enough warning for the heroes to avoid being ambushed, and a <strong>second later</strong>, six repulsive “statues” pounce on them from all sides. If the heroes fail their roll, the players are affected by the surprise condition as combat starts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players are not startled and make a successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Lore)</strong> or <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Nature) check</strong>, they can identify the species of their attackers. These squat killing machines are called Noghri, aliens seldom seen away from their home planet. The entire room is considered to be heavily obscured unless the players bring light along from lightsabers or glowrods.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DEATH COMMANDOS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The archive room has no light sources. Even if the heroes restored power to the sublevel, only the faint light from the corridor comes through the open door. The various shelves and cases do not offer cover. The Noghri are perched on marble columns in the far corner of the room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in this area, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s darker here than in any of the other areas you’ve visited so far. A chill breeze hits you from directly in front. How can there be a draft in an underground level? On the map, this room shows as an “L” shape, but you can’t see anything at all around the bend. As you advance, you have the sneaking suspicion that you’re being watched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NOGHRI WARRIORS (5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gray-skinned and compact Noghri are among the most recent and deadly additions to the Imperial ranks. Though an acute xenophobia has begun to manifest within the Galactic Empire, Darth Vader readily recognized the value of the species during a visit to their homeworld Honoghr. When the five foot-tall warriors proved a match for his 501st Legion <strong>stormtrooper</strong> escort, the Dark Lord immediately found a way to enslave the species. Destiny arguably brought the two together, for the Noghri’s frightful faces so resemble the masked visage of their new master, the likeness seems uncanny.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dubbed “Death Commandos,” the Noghri are perfectly evolved killing machines—quick, quiet and deceptively strong. In unarmed combat, they excel at stava, their martial art named after a ferocious native predator, and they wield Stokhli spray sticks or simple knives with deadly efficiency. Vader bestowed Draco with this squad of Noghri assassins in gratitude for the Inquisitor’s assistance in torturing the captured Jedi Knight Halagad Ventor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a flash, you are assaulted by aliens that look like gargoyles. They are short and blindingly fast. As the chaos of combat ensues, you can’t be sure, but the frightening faces of these warriors look like they might have been inspired by the armored mask of a certain Sith Lord—or vice-versa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NOGHRI WARRIOR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Noghri), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (combat suit)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 83 (11d8+33)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16 (+3) 20 (+5) 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 18 (+4) 12 (+1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +7 Perception +6, Stealth +9, Survival +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Honorghran</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assassinate.

If they stun or incapacitate the heroes, they bring the prisoners before Draco. Otherwise, the Noghri fight fiercely to prevent intruders from interrupting Draco, but they will be reasonable if they see that they are outmatched. They prefer to fight in melee, using their stealth and martial arts to devastating effect. If the heroes try to escape by entering the tunnel, the Noghri give chase.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each Noghri has 1000 credits each for a total of 6000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the Death Commandos, they are free to enter the tunnel leading down to Draco’s location.

The room also contains some ancient Jedi items, none of which offer much help to the heroes aside from a few wooden shields and lances. The items are held inside transparisteel display cases along the south and north walls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NEARING THE NEXUS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes investigate the opening in the far wall, they see that the crumbled floor and wall have revealed a tunnel. It slopes downward into utter darkness, and the rocky ground is made slippery by the natural spring that runs across the second sublevel of the academy. The slope is 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, prompting two <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks </strong>to get down, a player with a climb speed only makes one <strong>check.</strong> A hero who fails a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>9 or less</strong> suffers a minor slip but does not fall. A hero who fails a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>10 or more</strong> also causes a rockslide, dealing <strong>[[/r 2d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to himself and anyone below him. If the heroes have no light source, they must move even more cautiously and make an additional <strong>Strength (Athletics) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>The players if they have rope, may use that to lower themselves down instead, avoiding the <strong>checks</strong> entirely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTER THE DRAGON</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at the bottom, Valin Draco is waiting for them, literally surrounded by darkness. He has the controls to Thorla’s Universal Energy Cage in his possession and is studying the Qornah Holocron with the Rivan holocron gatekeeper. As the heroes approach, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You make out a figure in a flowing scarlet robe of septsilk. You recognize him from the message you received many <strong>months</strong> ago after your adventure on <strong>Bespin</strong>: Inquisitor Valin Draco. He is flanked on one side by a stern-looking female whose lightsaber gives a red tint to their surroundings. There is a glint in Draco’s eye and a chilling smile on his lips, as if he already knows more about you than you know about yourselves. Just behind Draco, an incandescent object floats in the air, seeming to grow out of a small cube strapped to Draco’s forearm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hiding behind rocks on both sides of the Inquisitor are two blackarmored Imperial <strong>shadow troopers.</strong> A player who manages to pass a <strong>DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> can barely make them out in the darkness. Draco has the Dark Jedi Raik Muun flanking him, red lightsaber ignited, and directly behind him hovers an indistinct blot resonating with evil. This is the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan, which provides Draco with advanced knowledge of Sith techniques throughout the fight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco is a methodical villain. His preferred method of dealing with his enemies is to convert them to his cause, a tactic that has worked equally well on Raik and the nighthunter, and that nearly succeeded on Jedi Master Vhiin’Thorla. Draco knows that to have reached this far, the heroes must have defeated challenges that would have sundered less formidable foes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, before Draco invites the heroes to join him, he greets them with a single word: “Crant?” This is the name of Draco’s nighthunter. It’s unlikely that the heroes will know this, so Draco elaborates:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Crant—my companion. Have you come to tell me that my nighthunter is dead?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can tell Draco whatever they wish. If they confirm that they have killed the beast, Draco betrays no emotion, though the glint in his eye dulls. However, he immediately gathers his composure and begins his entreaty as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I am Valin Draco, and, like you, I once thought myself a hero. During the Clone Wars, the brave men and women I commanded called me the ‘Valiant Dragon’ as we fought in epic conflicts for the corrupt Republic. But after I was left for dead on the battlefield of Parein II 4, flattering titles lost their meaning for me. “These are dark times, and I know that you’ve suffered great losses, that you wrestle with the same concerns of virtue and compromise that I did as a Jedi, the same concerns that have plagued the conscientious since time immemorial. Surrender yourselves to the Empire. I promise your treatment will be gentler, and you might even be given the chance to serve me. Surrender yourselves—or face your destiny.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco’s offer is sincere. Here are some possible answers to common questions that the heroes might have for the Inquisitor:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why do you serve the Empire? “Beware rash judgments. The difference between an enemy and a friend is not as obvious as we’d like to think. My allegiance to the Galactic Empire is born of necessity, and you will reap the benefits if you recognize that your destiny lies with me.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is your view of the dark side of the Force? “The dark side exists. Only the naïve and demented believe otherwise. It’s found in each of us without exception—Sith, Jedi, soldier, smuggler, noble, rogue, and romantic. I will show you how to control it so that you needn’t fear or deny it.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why don’t you join us? “I have already found my true self. I embraced my destiny when I took this Inquisitor’s garb. Now, quit this cowardly stalling, and reflect on my invitation, for this is the last time I extend it. Decide swiftly and without regret, for your choice and its effects were predetermined before these words ever obligated you to speak.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s highly unlikely that any of the heroes will take Draco up on his offer. However, this could be an opportunity for some dramatic storytelling. Perhaps one of the players has grown bored with her character. If so, collaborate with her in secret ahead of time so that her character joins Draco’s retinue for a devastating twist, similar to Vader’s revelation of Luke’s parentage in The Empire Strikes Back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In all likelihood, the heroes reject Draco’s supplication or simply <strong>attack</strong> him. Once they do, the disquieting glint in his eye returns, as if he’s foreseen their response. Draco ignites his lightsaber, Raik Muun takes up a protective position in front of him, and the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> prepare to snipe from their hiding spots. As soon as the heroes <strong>attack,</strong> Draco allows the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan to instruct him, teaching him some of the Dark Lord’s powers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes managed to free Master Thorla earlier in the adventure, he arrives at the beginning of the encounter to assist the heroes in their fight. If no heroes discover the means of separating Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper from its connection to the holocron, Thorla uses the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> to grant the heroes a reprieve from the Sith holocron’s influence over Draco on his turns. Thorla has Inspiration, which he saves until the heroes reduce Draco to half his hit points or fewer. When that occurs, on his next turn, Master Thorla gains a use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>, then uses it against Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper, spending the Inspiriation to peel the gatekeeper from the holocron. The gatekeeper howls in rage as it is stripped from the holocron. As the faux Rivan dissipates, the holocron begins to overload, and Draco rips it from his arm and hurls it at Thorla. The holocron shatters, unbalancing Thorla and knocking him into the chasm below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes did not free Master Thorla, he does not come to the rescue. However, he might contact <strong>Force-using</strong> heroes telepathically instead. A Force-using hero in telepathic contact with Thorla can use the Jedi Master’s <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> as though they were the players. Additionally, if the <strong>Force-using</strong> hero does not think to use Inspiration with <strong>Force Suppression,</strong> the Jedi Master tells the hero to do so when Draco is below half of his hit points.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Master Thorla is dead, the heroes receive none of the above benefits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4x CR 1 Shadow Troopers (Headhunter Block) 1x CR 4 Raik Munn (Inquisitor Knight Block) 1x CR 7 Draco (Inquisitor Master)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes start on the east side of the map, at the exit from the tunnel that leads back to the sublevel 2. The opponents are near the opposite side, as indicated on the map, at the end of a ledge that is 40 feet by 10 feet. Raik Muun is in front of Draco, and the four <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are hiding behind rocks, aiming at the heroes. There is another, narrower ledge on the south side of the map, but if the heroes take that route, the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> shoot at them. In the center of the room are two cavernous pits, at the bottom of which lies a body of water.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If his invitation to join him is rebuffed, Inquisitor Draco undergoes a sinister transformation and <strong>attacks</strong> with his minions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“As you die, rest assured that I reflected on you as on all enemies: despising that you must be wrong and I right, but reveling in the triumph of my convictions while whatever species of maggot indigenous to this world expedites the transition of your carcasses from this existence to the next.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While Draco speaks, the sinister blot hovering behind him seems to pulse and seethe with rage. Before your eyes, the wraith seems to transfer some of its dark energy into the Inquisitor, wreathing the Human in shadows. The evil holocron gatekeeper hovering in the room seems to writhe with malevolence, and there is clearly some vile connection between it and the Inquisitor. Draco’s eyes acquire a sickening gold hue, and his voice plummets in pitch as he gives a command to the woman and soldiers at his side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“My brave companions—kill them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nearly 6'5 tall, with closely cropped hair and a lantern jaw, Valin Draco looks every bit the heroic Jedi he once was. The former Padawan of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, Jedi Draco, the “Valiant Dragon,” embraced his role as a Republic commander in the Clone Wars wholeheartedly. However, at some point during the conflict, his heady determination to defeat the Separatist threat evolved into something pernicious, and he turned to the dark side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco was thought lost in the chaotic Battle of Parein II 4, but he emerged after the Clone Wars as one of the new Empire’s Jedi hunters. Left for dead and stranded on Parein II’s fourth moon, a weakened Draco was stalked by a nighthunter. Ultimately, Draco subdued the beast in a vicious confrontation, but not before the creature bit off his left thumb and clamped its massive fangs down around his throat. Draco has since replaced the missing thumb with a cybernetic substitute, while masking the glaring scars around his neck with the high collar of his Inquisitor’s tunic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco arrived in the Cularin system in the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> accompanied by a Lictor-class Imperial dungeon ship, Revelator.

A Zelosian, he defied nearly every stereotype of his gregarious people except for his knowledge of plant biology, and his Sith moniker is believed to have been culled from a corrupted Sith text, possibly written by Darth Revan. As the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith sometime between <strong>1,150</strong> and <strong>1,400 years ago,</strong> Rivan’s story is intimately tied to an object he called the Darkstaff. Drawn to this dark side artifact, Rivan erected a stronghold on the poisonous planet Almas, using the <strong>Force</strong> and his biological knowledge to terraform the world into a paradise. At first, Rivan desired to possess the Darkstaff, but when he learned that it was a malevolent vacuum of power, he became bent on destroying it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the New Sith Wars, Darth Rivan consolidated many dark siders into an army. To circumvent the betrayals common among Sith, he pioneered the creation of Battlelords. This radical process bonded one of Rivan’s Sith commanders—the Battlelord—through the <strong>Force</strong> to his or her troops, such that if subordinates tried to injure or kill their superior, the alchemical bond insured that the traitors would instead be the recipients of the <strong>damage</strong> they intended to inflict.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During a pivotal battle, Rivan simply vanished from the combat zone in a catastrophic and violent way. Legend relates that Rivan at last obtained possession of the Darkstaff that he both craved and feared, and that it created a hyperspace wormhole, known as a <strong>Force Storm,</strong> that annihilated Rivan’s Battlelord army. Caught in the eye of this unnatural tempest, Rivan was flung to a time and place far removed from Almas. He found himself on the planet Ruusan, caught in the War of Light and Dark between Lord Hoth’s Army of Light and Lord Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness. The Darkstaff left Rivan bereft of the <strong>Force,</strong> and when he encountered a <strong>Force-user</strong> of inconsequential power, the Dark Lord was easily dispatched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Under the influence of dark <strong>Force</strong> energies on Almas, the gatekeeper of Darth Rivan’s holocron has been given the ability to function independently and of its own free will, acting as the real Rivan would.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DARTH RIVAN'S HOLOCRON GATEKEEPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium hologram, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft fly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 17 (+3) 15 (+2) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Int +5, Wis +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Deception +7, Insight +6, Perception +4, Persuasion +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Immunities All</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Bocce, Dosh, Honoghran, Huttese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 0 (25 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aura of Malevolence.

Imperial <strong>shadow troopers</strong> might be mistaken for regular <strong>clone troopers,</strong> except that their stealth armor and red visors give them the appearance of demonic silhouettes. They are trained for reconnaissance and occasionally serve as guardians to vital facilities and personnel. Inquisitor Draco reasons that if they’re good enough for the Emperor’s secret Utapau storehouse, they’re good enough for him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unlike that of other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow trooper</strong> armor retains its distinctive pre-Imperial appearance. There is talk of eventually streamlining <strong>shadow trooper</strong> armor, but for now, their scarlet T-visors remain a haunting reminder of Palpatine’s bloody ascension to the rank of Emperor. Like all other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow troopers</strong> cannot be bribed, blackmailed, or seduced. Any such attempt automatically fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>shadow troopers’</strong> scarlet T-visors give the impression of demonic silhouettes, but their coordination and synchronization of movement reminds you that that these clones are highly trained killers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHADOW TROOPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (combat suit)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 23 (5d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 15 (+2) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Perception +4, Stealth +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

When her affections were not reciprocated, love turned to obsession, and Master Kirlocca dismissed her from the academy. Angered at these rejections, Raik became bent on revenge. She attempted to undermine the Jedi by impersonating members of the Jedi Order while publicly performing acts of sabotage and chaos. Muun also learned of the existence of an evil creature called a t'salak, and by kidnapping and impersonating a Jedi, she gained possession of the beast. Successfully fissioning the creature into multiple entities, she attempted to use two t'salaks to turn some Jedi into crazed killers during a peace conference. Her plan failed, but Master Kirlocca lost his life defeating the t'salaks, and Raik escaped.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Raik returned to her base on the planet Tilnes, she learned about the decimation of Jedi throughout the galaxy as a result of Order 66. Her revenge was now denied, but she could still fuel the rumors of the “Jedi Rebellion.” Raik went to Coruscant to confront those responsible for the destruction of the self-righteous <strong>Force-users,</strong> not sure if she should thank them or kill them. That’s when she met Valin Draco. The Inquisitor saw enormous potential in the wild-eyed Dark Jedi and asked her to join him. Raik felt that she had finally found someone who would love her back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Raik has accompanied Draco on various assignments, indulging in the opportunity to hunt Jedi. When Draco travels to Almas, Raik's familiarity with the academy proves essential, as does the t’salak she brought along.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fire-haired woman stalks toward you, clad in a dark version of the Inquisitor’s attire. She appears Human, but something about her says otherwise. Then you see it. Draco’s gaze shows ruthlessness and calculation, but this Dark Jedi’s entrancing, green-slitted pupils harbor only murder and dementia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RAIK MUUN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (human), neutral dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (battle precognition)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 113 (25d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11 (+0) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 13 (+1) 12 (+1) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Cha +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Intimidation +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 11</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting.

The <strong>shadow troopers</strong> have the advantage of darkvision. A few large rocks scattered about the cave can offer concealment, or they can be lifted with the <strong>Force</strong> and thrown at opponents. Anyone standing too close to the openings in the center of the area risks falling over the edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BEHEMOTH FROM BELOW</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At any point when Draco finds himself below half of his hit points, or if his apprentice and <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are dead, he retreats to a back entrance that opens into an immense cavern that is spectacularly lit by bioluminescent, multicolored lichen coating the walls. Draco retreats onto a natural rock overpass bridging a wide chasm that appears as bottomless as it is black. Even in flight, the Inquisitor still tries to push players off the ledge. But Draco is growing desperate, and his connection to Rivan weakens as his resolve does the same. He is prepared to make his last stand here as long as he deprives the heroes of the object they desire—the Qornah Holocron.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, there is one factor Inquisitor Draco hasn’t accounted for. Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper has not been completely forthcoming with him. If the gatekeeper couldn’t retain control of Draco, he planned to summon the real k’kayeh dragon, which has grown to a massive 200 meters (as big as some space slugs) since the Dark Lord first created the monster more than a <strong>thousand years ago.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the gatekeeper is stripped from the holocron, his final howl of rage awakens the k’kayeh and draws it upward. If the gatekeeper is not separated from the holocron, he chooses to summon the beast at this moment. Either way, the behemoth is unleashed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Draco flees onto the bridge formation, he threatens to destroy the Quornah Holocron, holding it out over the chasm as tendrils of <strong>Force lightning</strong> flash from his hands. Though the beast has been released, it is not completely uncontrolled. Still seething with the dark side of the <strong>Force</strong> from his tutelage under the Sith holocron gatekeeper, Draco is able to control the beast—at least enough to keep it from devouring him. Likewise, he bends the massive strikes of <strong>Force lightning</strong> to his will, causing them to lash out at the heroes while he nimbly steps between them. Draco plans to destroy the heroes here, and unless they can defeat him, they will lose</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter begins with Draco entering the room and moving to the middle of the large stone bridge that stretches across this canyon. After the events described in the boxed text below, the heroes should be at the entrance to the cavern, with Draco across the bridge, waiting for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the first heroes enter the cavern where this encounter takes place, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco makes a stand midway on the overpass traversing the black gulf. A red lightsaber hisses in his right hand, angled down and away from him, while he extends the precious holocron over the abyss in his left. Then a sound like rolling thunder causes the caverns to shudder, as if the planet itself were growling in fury. Abruptly, as if the sky’s been turned upside down, two blue bolts of lightning the size of starfighters explode toward you from below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the seething electrical masses smashes into the ceiling high above, producing a shower of man-sized boulders. The other mammoth blue bolt sideswipes the bridge, missing you by a mere meter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On the heels of that familiar, unnatural lightning comes a monster straight out of your nightmares—200 meters of golden sinew and obscenity, led by a gaping maw lined with teeth bigger than the tallest Wookiee. It looks identical to the dreambeast you fought earlier, and for a heartbeat you hope that you’re still dreaming. But this is real, and this leviathan makes the illusion you battled earlier look like a tame womp rat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco, now without the aid of the Sith holocron gatekeeper, has gained some control over both the dreambeast and the <strong>Force lightning</strong> erupting from the abyss below. Before the encounter begins, Draco regains 20 hitpoints from the dark side knowledge he has retained, knowing that he’ll need them in the coming fight. Remember to include any <strong>damage, HP,</strong> or spent <strong>force points</strong> in this encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As a <strong>bonus action,</strong> Inquisitor Draco can force an arc of <strong>Force lightning</strong> lances out at a creature, forcing it to make a <strong>DC 16 Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On a failed <strong>save,</strong> the creature takes <strong>16 ([[/r 3d10[lightning] # Lightning damage]]) damage</strong>, <strong>half</strong> on a success. Additionally, all creatures within<strong> 5 feet </strong>of the <strong>target</strong> take <strong>half</strong> the <strong>damage</strong> as well. As a result, he never uses this against targets in which he is engaged in melee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR DRACO TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco knows that, alone, he could easily be overwhelmed by a group of heroes. As such, he takes a much more defensive position than he did in the previous encounter. He uses the ambient <strong>Force</strong> lightning to keep multiple enemies from getting too close to him each <strong>round.</strong> Similarly, he will use Choke to shut down one hero, letting the k’kayeh dragon do the <strong>attacking</strong> for him (while still shooting an arc of <strong>Force lightning).</strong> If no heroes are engaged in melee, Draco uses his action to dodge, hoping the disadvantage to <strong>attackers</strong> will prevent them from hitting him. Draco uses Saber Reflect when appropriate to deal with any <strong>attacks</strong> that get by his AC, hoping to draw one or two <strong>melee attackers</strong> to him at a time so that he can whittle them down rather than face a barrage from all of the heroes at once.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco will also begin using his Legendary Action abilities as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes deal the killing blow to Draco, he drops the Qornah Holocron at his feet. With a gasp, he goes wide-eyed and tumbles from the side of the bridge into the abyss. As Draco plummets into darkness, the <strong>Force lightning</strong> stops, and the k’kayeh dragon descends into the abyss once more, presumably after the body of the Inquisitor. With Draco defeated and the holocron recovered, the heroes need to escape from the collapsing academy with haste.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two environmental features make this encounter challenging for the heroes. First, most of the combat will take place on a large stone bridge with no railings. Any heroes pushed off of the bridge must attempt to catch themselves or they will fall into the abyss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second, the k’kayeh dragon stretches up to menace the heroes. Though the dragon would normally be far too powerful for them to face, in this encounter, it acts more like an obstacle than a true opponent. The dragon has an <strong>Initiative bonus</strong> of +6 and an AC of 18. If successfully hit by a ranged <strong>attack,</strong> the beast takes a cumulative <strong>1d4 penalty</strong> to its bite <strong>attack</strong> for each ranged <strong>attack</strong> that hits it. (You should make it clear to the heroes that their combined efforts are having a combined effect, giving <strong>ranged attackers</strong> a role in the encounter while melee combatants deal with Draco.) Once per <strong>round,</strong> the dragon snaps at any heroes in the chamber who are not engaged in melee with Draco, making a melee weapon <strong>attack</strong> with a <strong>+8 </strong>to hit. A successful hit deals <strong>16 ([[/r 2d8+7[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to the target and moves the target<strong> 5 feet</strong> in any direction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEAVING THE ECHOES BEHIND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The giant dragon causes major tremors, and the academy’s foundations, already weakened by a major bombardment and <strong>several years</strong> of misuse, start to collapse.

If it needs repairs, they have to perform the work uninterrupted for a <strong>few hours</strong>. The Imperial dungeon ship that Draco brought is still in the system, accompanied by his Star Destroyer, the <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> but they are outside the comet field. The heroes detect the Imperial ships once they clear the comet field, but the ships are too far out of weapons range to <strong>attack.</strong> If the heroes scan the ships, they identify one as the Assiduous (which they should recognize from the battle over <strong>Bespin</strong>) and the other as a Lictor-class dungeon ship named Revelator. They could not detect the ships on their way in because the Imperials were stationed in Cularin’s shadow. But now, not having received a report from Draco in <strong>several hours</strong>, the Revelator approaches the limits of the system to launch another shuttle. It does not pursue the heroes, but it <strong>attacks</strong> if they are daring enough to come within range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes leave the Cularin system, they can reach the last known coordinates of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. The trip back takes<strong> one day</strong>, giving the heroes time to rest, treat their wounds, and study the holocron. Any <strong>non-Force-sensitive</strong> heroes find the cube unresponsive, but a <strong>force user</strong> can conjure the holocron’s gatekeeper, Master Qornah, who answers a few basic questions but insists on the presence of another Jedi Master.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When they finally approach the Nebulon-B frigate, the heroes receive a communication from <strong>Captain Verana</strong> asking if their mission was successful.

When the heroes are ready, they are instructed to go to the briefing room to meet with <strong>Master Denia</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Denia</strong> asks the heroes for the holocron and activates it. She then listens as the heroes recount their adventure. At the mention of Draco’s name, <strong>Denia </strong>displays a brief look of shock and becomes very pensive thereafter, as if distracted by something far away. Gathering her composure, she states the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This sounds like quite an ordeal you experienced, and whether you follow the Jedi ways or not, you have contributed greatly to the enlightenment of the Force.

{"_id":"nAmgdXVYtXsBpWDW","name":"Part 3: Imperial Prison Facility","content":"<h1>Part 3: Imperial Prison Facility</h1>\n<p>Once the heroes have concluded their visit to the <strong>Felucian village</strong> (and prevented the Imperials from reporting its location), they can make their way to the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. Their <strong>Felucian scout</strong> leads them around obstacles and potential threats and takes them directly to the facility. Their guide doesn’t say much on the journey — and unless the heroes have a translating droid, they won’t understand him, anyway — and simply leads them to their target with solemn determination.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive, they discover that the <strong>prison facility</strong> is a relatively squat, two-story building in characteristic Imperial style: gray walls with a slight outward slant, no visible windows, and a plain visage that leaves no room for accouterments. The second story of the building is visibly smaller than the ground floor, and blinking lights line the top floor’s edges. A large set of blast doors denotes the ground floor entry to the building, while a single gun turret (which appears to be an assault cannon built into the wall) juts out a <strong>few meters </strong>to the door’s left. Otherwise, there are no other visible entrances or exits to the facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Stormtroopers </strong>stand guard at the facility’s blast doors, while the low hum of speeder engines indicates that there might be <strong>scout troopers</strong> on patrol nearby. Additionally, any hero who succeeds on a <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong> hears heavy thudding sounds in the distance, along with the noises of plants being crushed, indicating the presence of a walker of some kind.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the heroes, their <strong>Felucian scout</strong> is aware of a secret entrance. He leads them to the northwest corner of the building, where a ventilation grate barely hangs on its bolts. With the right application of force (dealing at least <strong>10 points of damage</strong> to the grate), it can be pried free, giving the heroes a way into the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</p>\n<p>Within the facility, the heroes will find that everything follows the typical Imperial style, with standard metal walls (<strong>DR 10</strong>, <strong>150 hp</strong>) and metal doors (<strong>DR 10</strong>, <strong>50 hp</strong>). Additionally, the facility has a central computer system with a <strong>Slicing</strong> <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>20 </strong>without the correct code cylinder. All of the doors in the facility’s interior are unlocked by default. However, the exterior blast doors are sealed from the inside. From the outside, the doors can be opened only by slicing the computer (using the terminal and scomp link that provides access to the computer).</p>\n<p>An overall map of the first floor appears below. Each detailed encounter in the facility also has its own map.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Prison%201st%20Floor.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"463\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>That Was Too Easy</strong></p>\n<p>After entering and making their way through the facility, some heroes may wonder how a secret prison for political malcontents could be infiltrated by novices so easily. In truth, the entire rescue of Admiral Varth is a setup designed to lure the heroes into complacency and get them to accept the Admiral into their confidences. Varth is merely pretending to be a traitor. He and Inquisitor Draco are the only two people who know the truth of the ploy. All other members of the Empire, including the Imperials stationed at the prison facility, believe that the Admiral really is a traitor. This level of deception was necessary to ensure that someone as resourceful as Bail Organa didn’t find out about the ruse somehow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>P1: Medical Bay</h2>\n<p>Originally a standard medical bay intended to heal prisoners who were injured during interrogations, the bay has been transformed into a science lab for the slightly demented <strong>Captain Vischera</strong>. The room is littered with experimental equipment designed to alter the genetic material of the <strong>captain’s </strong>test subjects—namely, the <strong>Felucians </strong>that the Empire has been snatching from the nearby villages. Three filled bacta tanks line the far wall. Currently, the tanks are empty of patients, but wear and scratches on the inside of each tank show that whatever had been floating within had tried to claw its way out.</p>\n<p>A former Imperial scientist and now the head of the<strong> prison facility</strong>, <strong>Captain Vischera </strong>has been altering the genetic code of <strong>Felucians </strong>to create mutant warriors. When the Confederacy collapsed, many Separatist secrets fell into the hands of the Empire, among them a few that <strong>Captain Vischera</strong> found most intriguing. Particularly of interest were experiments performed by the Techno Union on the natives of the planet <strong>Nelvaan</strong>, transforming them into massive, violent warriors that could be bent to their creator’s will.</p>\n<p>After months of experimentation, <strong>Vischera </strong>has managed to create two such monsters out of Felucian<strong> </strong>hosts, at the cost of many lives. Additionally, a small number of <strong>Felucians </strong>that were part of the evolutionary process still remain alive, and they are kept here for further observation.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in this room, they must fight the mutated <strong>Felucians </strong>and the medical attendant. See “<strong>Imperial Research Lab</strong>” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<h2>Imperial Research Lab - CR 2</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[0QJpk2uNri46nDNF]{1-06 Imperial Research Lab}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Once the heroes have dealt with the encounter, they have a chance to recover some experimental medical technology. Though most of the equipment is far too large to carry away, the experiments include a set of <em>healing stimulants </em>that <strong>Vischera </strong>has been using to stabilize his monstrous creations. There are <em>10 active samples</em> of <em>stimulants</em>, each loaded into an injector and ready for use. The <em>stimulants </em>are used as a part of a short rest, and each stimulant used allows the recipient to use one additional <strong>hit die</strong> to heal until the next <strong>long rest</strong>. However, when a <em>stimulant </em>is used, the recipient receives one level of <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>. The stimulants allow for additional healing, but they put a great deal of strain on the body when active.</p>\n<p>@Item[PfHnPliCxc8VNpz8]{Healing Stimulant}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>The <strong>exhaustion</strong> effect is also included in the item description for the Healing Stimulant.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>P2: Defense Turret</h2>\n<p>Unaware of the damaged ventilation hatch the heroes used to enter the facility, the Empire focuses most of its defenses on frontal assaults. A modified <strong>assault cannon </strong>has been mounted into the wall of this area, pointing outward, and an <strong>Imperial gunner</strong> mans the turret at all times. Additionally, a small number of other personnel remain on duty in the area to assist with spotting enemies and, when necessary, defending the turret from the inside. A turret gunner manning the assault cannon always has <strong>three-quarter cover</strong> from targets outside the <strong>prison facility</strong>, and all other targets in the area have <strong>total cover</strong> and concealment from the outside. The <strong>assault cannon</strong> can be removed from the wall as an action, though this also decouples the <strong>assault cannon</strong> from its tripod and power source, which provides it with unlimited ammunition.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not take care to be quiet, or if a fight breaks out elsewhere on the ground floor of the facility, the Imperial personnel in this area will investigate the disturbance. However, most of the doors in the facility block sound relatively well, and as such any combat that takes place behind closed doors usually will not alert the Imperials in the defense turret. See “<strong>Defense Turret Controls</strong>” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<h2>Defense Turret Controls - CR 3</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2K1gCPjJLuuS8cJq]{1-07 Defense Turret Controls}</p>\n<h2>P3: Communications Center</h2>\n<p>This communications center helps route all of the Imperial communications on <strong>Felucia</strong>. Originally, the <strong>prison facility</strong> was a communications station before it was converted into a holding area for political prisoners. As such, a large portion of this room features advanced communications equipment. However, <strong>Felucia </strong>is a backwater planet, so there is usually little going on to justify any kind of largescale activity, though the communications center does coordinate with the <strong>Victory-class Star Destroyer </strong>in orbit.</p>\n<p>See “<strong>Communications Center</strong>” for more information on running this encounter. When the heroes enter the room, <strong>Lieutenant Aden </strong>and the comm operators immediately attempt to sound an alarm.</p>\n<p>Communications Center - CR 3</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[RPQrWyWE1jBV4xru]{1-08 Communications Center}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Once the Imperials in this area have been neutralized, the heroes can plant the explosive device given to them by <strong>Vazus Mandrake</strong>. In addition, they can learn an important piece of information. Any hero who accesses the computers in this room immediately discovers that a high-priority message was just received from the <strong>Victory-class Star Destroyer</strong> in orbit. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//ROUTED...SECURITY ENCRYPTION CONFIRMED</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//FROM PRAKITH CITADEL COMM CENTER VIA HOLONET NODE 6673-ALPHA</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//FROM NODE 6673-ALPHA VIA STAR DESTROYER ASSIDUOUS</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Priority 1 Message Follows:</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Prepare former Admiral Gilder Varth for transfer to the Citadel. Inquisitor Draco will be arriving within a standard Felucian day/night cycle to take custody of the prisoner. You are instructed to have your medical technicians ensure that Varth is fully rested and at his highest possible strength.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogation chemicals should be administered to Varth upon notification that the Inquisitor has arrived on Felucia. Varth will be transferred by shuttle to the Assiduous before Inquisitor Draco takes custody. Time from administration of interrogation chemicals to transfer to the Inquisitor’s personal transport should fall within an acceptable window of 27 to 54 minutes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//END TRANSMISSION</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">@JournalEntry[d2oGkhzriIorbFif]{04 Handout 4 - High-Priority Message}</p>\n<p><strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> sent the message to make sure that everyone in the facility believes that <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is a traitor to the Empire. Only <strong>Varth </strong>and <strong>Draco </strong>know the truth of the deception.</p>\n<h2>P4: Prison Block</h2>\n<p>The small <strong>prison block</strong> where <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is being held is unlike most Imperial detention centers. Instead of having individual holding cells, the <strong>prison block</strong> features an open but secure area where the <strong>prisoners </strong>share a living space. However, the space is filthy and the <strong>prisoners </strong>are treated poorly, and a former Imperial <strong>Admiral </strong>is no exception. Unlike the other locations in the facility, the <strong>prison block</strong> is closely monitored. As soon as the heroes enter the room, they find themselves under attack from the guards, who have orders to shoot first and ask questions later.</p>\n<p>See “<strong>Detention Block F-1A</strong>” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<h2>Detention Block F-1A</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[0X6rPJuhLbHF0DbX]{1-09 Detention Block F-1A}</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is a slightly overweight man with close-cropped gray hair and a bushy mustache. He has clearly seen better days; his right eye is swollen and bruised, and a trail of dried blood stains the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>If the heroes manage to free <strong>Varth</strong>, he is grateful but confused as to the identity of his rescuers. He expected to be freed by <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> staff, not by hired freelancers. However, he is willing to accept whatever stories the heroes tell him as long as they promise to get him out of the facility. <strong>Varth </strong>is eager to take the ruse to the next stage and pass on so-called vital secrets that will lure <strong>Organa </strong>and his agents into a trap.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is fairly guarded about the specifics of his imprisonment. Unsure of who the heroes are, he doesn’t want to reveal too much, but he confirms that he is a former Imperial Admiral who has been funneling information to “<em><strong>interested third parties</strong></em>” for some time now. He says that he was captured a short while ago and is being held at the Felucian <strong>prison facility </strong>until the proper Imperial authorities can arrive to retrieve him.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth </strong>agrees to help the heroes escape from the facility, but he’s not terribly interested in helping them fight. He can give them advice, but he is reluctant to pick up a blaster, even in his own defense. If pressed, he lends his aid, but in combat he usually provides the heroes with tactical assistance rather than shooting at anyone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/gilder_varth_art.webp\" width=\"450\" height=\"624\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[wDYAhgEkfXU65oaw]{05 - Handout 5 - Gilder Varth}</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[JJXelfwaesLxl5DV]{Admiral Gilder Varth}</strong></p>\n<h2>Can't Get Out That Way!</h2>\n<p>When the heroes have retrieved <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>(and possibly planted the explosives in the communications center), they likely make their way back to the ventilation grate they used to enter the facility. However, two developments threaten their plans. First, they come upon a disturbing sight—just outside the grate, a large number of <strong>@Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{stormtroopers} </strong>stand around the crumpled body of their <strong>Felucian guide</strong>, and an <strong>@Actor[LLxezY3EqvHI9H7r]{AT-ST}</strong> stomps around the exterior of the facility. Second, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> sends a message over the heroes’ comlinks — the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is operational again, and they can leave the planet whenever they are ready. If the heroes don’t remember the second floor of the facility (which they should have seen from the outside), <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> mentions that some of the Imperials he dealt with mentioned the presence of a command center on the second floor. He suggests that they make their way up there and attempt to reach the roof. From there, they can call <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> for a pickup and avoid the Imperial presence outside.</p>\n<h2>Turbolift Cluster</h2>\n<p>This cluster of four standard turbolifts ferries troops and officers between the two floors of the <strong>prison facility</strong>. Unlike the rest of the computers in the facility, the computers that operate the turbolifts are hostile to anyone without a particular code cylinder—specifically, the one possessed by <strong>Lieutenant Aden</strong>. If the heroes have retrieved Aden’s code cylinder, they can insert it in a port inside the turbolift, making the control computers helpful and gaining access to the command center on the second floor.</p>\n<h2>P5: Command Center - CR 4</h2>\n<p>When the players take the turbolift, move on to: @JournalEntry[7rtcUeciWoVQHGCf]{1-10 Command Center}</p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>When the heroes finally make their way to the roof of the facility with <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> brings the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>swooping in to rescue them. As laser fire spatters ineffectually against the ship’s shields, the heroes can climb into the transport via the extended landing ramp. If the heroes planted the explosives in the communications center, the first round of explosions begin tearing through the facility, growing louder and closer with each passing second. Once everyone is on board,<strong> Captain Okeefe</strong> blasts off, and within moments the ship is safely away from the lush fungal world.</p>\n<p>However, the <strong>Star Destroyer </strong>that grounded the players to is still in orbit and has been attempting to scout the planet with <strong>TIE/LN squadrons </strong>to find them, a small squadron of <strong>TIE/LN fighters </strong>is in range to fire on the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> in an attempt to stop them from completing their rescue mission.</p>\n<p>This encounter serves as an entry-level space battle for players to gain their first <strong>deployment rank</strong>. It shouldn't serve as a roadblock to the players but rather serve as a space battle tutorial. The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is too far away to assist its fighters and the <strong>TIE's</strong> should be relatively easy to destroy for the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The heroes should also be in a position to get into any deployment they desire. The <strong>Banshee</strong> has the <strong>Coordinator</strong>, <strong>2 Gunner</strong>, <strong>Mechanic</strong>, <strong>Operator</strong> and <strong>Pilot </strong>deployments though it is likely Captain Okeefe fills the <strong>Pilot</strong> deployment with Crash filling any spare role. Feel free to have <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> knocked out or otherwise indisposed from the opening barrage if a player wishes to pilot the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>If the players wish to escape the battle rather than fight it out, they can plot a hyperspace course out of the combat using the '<strong>Astrogation Time Taken</strong>' table in <strong>Chapter 8</strong> of <em>Starships of the Galaxy</em>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>After the encounter with the <strong>TIE/LN Starfighters </strong>is concluded <strong>Captain OKeefe</strong> tells the heroes that she has been instructed to rendezvous with a starship in the remote and uninhabited <strong>Zandrax System</strong>. She goes out of her way not to mention <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> name, especially not in front of <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, and explains that their benefactor has set up a refuge for them. Upon exiting hyperspace, the heroes are greeted with the impressive vision of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, a brand-new Nebulon-B frigate that will serve as a mobile safe house for the <strong>Admiral</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> lands the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>in one of the <em><strong>Resurgence’s </strong></em>docking bays, and once they disembark, they meet the captain of the frigate, <strong>Adrian Verana</strong>. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> is a tall and slender man with jet-black hair and a finely trimmed beard that hugs his square jaw. He is dressed in the sterile uniform of an Alderaanian officer, and his dark eyes seem to weigh each hero carefully as he speaks to them. Captain Verana tells the heroes that they have been assigned quarters on the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, and that the ship’s facilities (including the medical bay) are available at any time. Moreover, the agreed-upon credits have been transferred into their bank accounts, and they are free to confirm the transaction on terminals in their quarters.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth i</strong>s escorted away by several Alderaanian Security agents, who look at the former Imperial with a mix of suspicion and interest. Once <strong>Varth</strong> is gone, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> tells the heroes that <strong>Senator Organa</strong> is thankful for their assistance and forever grateful that they went to such risks to aid him. If the heroes are willing, Verana offers them permanent quarters aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>in exchange for their assistance in the near future. Depending on the results of <strong>Varth’s </strong>debriefing, Verana believes that the Senator might have further need of clandestine agents to act on his behalf. He urges the heroes to keep as quiet as possible about the Senator’s involvement. Even though <strong>Varth </strong>has been communicating with <strong>Organa</strong> on a regular basis, now that they have taken overt action against the Empire, they do not wish to incriminate the Senator in any way.</p>\n<p>If the heroes mention the message regarding Inquisitor <strong>Draco's </strong>visit to <strong>Felucia</strong>, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> becomes troubled and mutters that they might have uncovered something far more involved than a simple Imperial traitor. An Imperial Inquisitor should be a significant concern for any Jedi or <strong>Force</strong>-using characters as well—the chief concern of the Inquisitorius is hunting down, capturing, and killing <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive beings of all stripes.</p>\n<h2>Next Adventure: A Wretched Hive</h2>\n<p>A Wretched Hive, the next adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, will take the heroes to the planet <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, where they encounter a Hutt crime lord and are drawn into his world of vice and violence. Not only will the heroes need to ingratiate themselves with the vile gangster <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, but they will also discover new secrets about Imperial projects and meet a <strong>Jedi Master</strong> who will play an integral role in the unfolding campaign.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> finishing the adventure</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>","folder":"ltQz712CRglJoUNT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

These <strong>thugs</strong> are in the employ of the <strong>Darga the</strong> <strong>Hutt </strong>and feel no real loyalty to <strong>Raden </strong>other than the fact that <strong>Darga </strong>ordered them to accompany the Devaronian.

The excavation droid has climbing claws and magnetic feet that allow it to work on the top and the underside of the planet’s bridge cities.

The heroes should realize that they need the Devaronian alive, but in case they try to use lethal force, he surrenders if reduced to fewer than <strong>15 hit points</strong>. If this occurs, <strong>Darga’s </strong>thugs attempt to flee.</p>\n<p><strong>Raden </strong>is reluctant to help the heroes.

This first adventure will get the heroes together and launch them down a path to making a big difference in the galaxy, and the heroes should advance to <strong>3rd level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this adventure, the heroes should become acquainted with one another, meet up with famous <strong>Senator Bail Organa</strong>, and travel to the remote planet of <strong>Felucia </strong>to recover a former Imperial Admiral who has information about a secret project that the Empire has hatched in the months since its rise.</p>\n<h2>Starting the Campaign</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign opens some months after the rise of the Empire, with the <strong>Clone Wars</strong> a very recent and vivid memory for most beings in the galaxy. The Empire has begun tightening its grip on star systems throughout the galaxy, and <strong>Darth Vader</strong> stands at the newly declared Emperor’s right hand, crushing any opposition and hunting down the last remnants of the <strong>Jedi Order</strong>. In these short months since the fall of the Republic, many have joined the Empire willingly, including the <strong>Core Worlds</strong> whose Human nobles stand to benefit a great deal from its tyranny. Similarly, many others have begun rebelling against Imperial oppression, finding themselves driven out of their homes (or worse) and forced to live in a galaxy that tolerates no opposition to the Empire. Throughout the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, the heroes must deal with the reality that the Empire is a monolithic threat without any kind of organized opposition, and dealing with agents of the Empire can be dangerous.</p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties the heroes face in terms of Imperial dominance, they are in a unique position to deal the first significant blow against the Empire. In the first adventure, the heroes will come face to face with the man who will become their clandestine benefactor,<strong> @Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Senator Bail Organa}</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">. In the new Empire, seditious acts are punished harshly, and as such the heroes will find that they must be extremely cautious in their actions. With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, the heroes of the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Dawn of Defiance</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> campaign may find that a one-way trip to </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Kessel</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> is the best they can hope for if they fall into the hands of the Empire.</span></p>\n<p>The first act of the campaign (comprised of the first three adventures—<em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, and <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>) introduces the heroes to one another and to some of the key figures in the campaign. Over the course of the first arc, the heroes discover that the Empire has a secret project in the works that could have dire consequences for the galaxy if it comes to fruition. Thanks to the help of former Imperial <strong>@Actor[JJXelfwaesLxl5DV]{Admiral Gilder Varth}</strong>, whom the heroes should rescue at the conclusion to the first adventure, the heroes learn that the Empire’s secret project has left a trail of money and slaves that they can follow to find the truth. During the first three adventures, the heroes travel to famous planets such as <strong>Alderaan</strong>, <strong>Bespin</strong>, <strong>Cato </strong><strong>Neimoidia</strong>, and <strong>Felucia</strong>, fighting Imperial stormtroopers, destroying secret labs and prisons, encountering vile Hutt gangsters, and participating in a dangerous <strong>sabacc </strong>tournament where the buy-in might be more than they can afford. The first adventure, <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, is relatively straightforward, allowing the heroes to become accustomed to one another and the rules. Each subsequent adventure leads the heroes down new paths and introduces different styles of play.</p>\n<p>Certain kinds of heroes will find it easier than others to flourish in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign. First and foremost, the heroes should view the Empire as both a threat and an enemy. As the major villainous entity of the campaign, the Empire represents something that is to be feared and loathed, and characters with Imperial sympathies will likely fisnd themselves in conflict with the overarching plot. Otherwise, the heroes can come from almost any background and profession. As long as they are willing to fight against the Empire (both covertly and openly), they should find the campaign engaging and exciting. Not every hero needs to be an idealistic freedom fighter; smugglers, bounty hunters, and free traders have just as much to gain from weakening the Empire as rebellious troops do. If the heroes’ motivation is personal profit or increasing their own power, they could do worse than to work for<strong> Bail Organa</strong>. Not only is he rich, but he is also powerful and influential, and his influence could very easily be transferred to any heroes that get on his good side.</p>\n<h3><strong>Adventure Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>After a chance encounter on a space station with a desperate agent of <strong>Senator Bail Organa </strong>of <strong>Alderaan</strong>, the heroes negotiate with a local crime lord and obtain valuable cargo intended for the Senator. Once they deliver the cargo, the heroes learn that it is actually a <strong>man frozen in carbonite</strong> who carries secret information for the Senator. Based on this information, the heroes are hired (as friends of<strong> Bail Organa</strong>, enemies of the Empire, or freelance entrepreneurs) to fly to the planet <strong>Felucia </strong>and discover the fate of a turncoat <strong>Imperial Admiral</strong>. If the Admiral still lives, they are to bring him back to <strong>Alderaan</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes arrive to find <strong>Felucia </strong>under tight Imperial control. After a brief skirmish with some Imperial starships in orbit, their ship makes a hard landing on <strong>Felucia</strong> to avoid detection. The ship is damaged, though <strong>@Actor[TgAWl2DRpBm2ZdsF]{Captain Okeefe}</strong> believes it can be repaired. Once they are prepared, the heroes venture out into <strong>Felucia’s</strong> jungles in search of signs of civilization. After fighting their way through the local flora and fauna, they discover a hidden village of <strong>Felucians </strong>that have fled deep into the jungles to escape Imperial oppression.</p>\n<p>The heroes negotiate for a guide to take them to a nearby Imperial facility known to the locals as the “Vanishing Place.” In truth, this is a prison for Imperial dissidents and traitors where <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>is being held. The heroes prepare to set off for the prison when a cry goes up in the village—a scout trooper has just spotted the village and is headed back to alert the Empire! This leads into a chase scene in which the heroes ride <strong>kybucks</strong> in pursuit of the scout trooper. Once the trooper has been stopped, the heroes convince the <strong>Felucians</strong> to lead them to the Imperial base immediately so that they can rescue the Admiral and stop bringing danger to the hidden village.</p>\n<p>The heroes and their guide set off for the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. It is heavily guarded from the outside, but the <strong>Felucian</strong> guide knows a secret way in. Once inside the base, the heroes find it more lightly guarded (and more along the lines of what they can handle). During the search for <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, the heroes come across a communication from Imperial <strong>Naval Command </strong>indicating that <strong>&lt;&lt;Inquisitor Draco&gt;&gt;</strong> is en route to <strong>Felucia</strong> to take custody of the Admiral. The heroes fight their way through the facility and eventually find <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> in the detention block. They free him and head back to the secret entrance where their <strong>Felucian</strong> guide supposedly awaits their return.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the heroes find trouble instead. Their guide lies dead, and Imperials are gathering outside the facility. About this time, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> sends the heroes a message: She has completed repairs to her ship and can pick them up when they are ready. On their way to the roof, the heroes must deal with the cruel <strong>&lt;&lt;Captain Vischera&gt;&gt;</strong> and his genetically modified bodyguards. Once they reach the roof, they board <strong>Okeefe’s</strong> ship and blast off from <strong>Felucia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The adventure concludes as the heroes bring <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> to the rendezvous point designated by <strong>Senator Organa</strong>. There, the heroes are introduced to the Nebulon-B frigate <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, which has been commissioned by <strong>Organa</strong> to serve as a mobile hiding place for the Admiral. Aboard the Resurgence, <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>is debriefed and provides the heroes and <strong>Senator Organa</strong> with information related to a top-secret Imperial project.</p>\n<h3>Opening Crawl</h3>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before their first adventure, consider using the boxed text below to introduce the Dawn of Defiance campaign:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[eDWVCu54lvTtXZzZ]{Opening Crawl}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"ltQz712CRglJoUNT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"rJGowrXQOXO6q9Bx","name":"3-02 Imperial Threats","content":"<h2>Imperial Threats</h2>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>When the <strong>encounter</strong> begins, the <strong>two Theelin bodyguards</strong> should be placed close to <strong>Baron Kithriss;</strong> while both need not be <strong>adjacent to him</strong>, at least one should be. The <strong>encounter</strong> takes place on a nonspecific walkway in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> the precise location of which depends on where the players encounter the <strong>Baron</strong> and his entourage. Feel free to add other obstacles to the encounter area to fit the scene as it plays out.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the encounter begins, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Two Theelin women, attired in padded jumpsuits with small pieces of armor attached at the shoulders, thighs, and forearms, stand close to a Human man who is obviously of nobility, and likely from a Core world. While the trio remains close together, four nearly identical men carrying blaster rifles fan out and take up positions as if looking to defend a bunker on a war-torn battlefield.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Undercover Clone Troopers</h4>\n<p>Drawn from the very first batch of <strong>clone troopers</strong> produced on <strong>Kamino,</strong> these <strong>clone troopers</strong> have aged much faster than normal Humans and, as such, have been removed from active duty as <strong>stormtroopers.</strong> This particular group of <strong>clones</strong> has been assigned by the Empire not only to guard <strong>Baron Kithriss</strong> but also to observe him. If the <strong>Baron</strong> shows any signs of instability as a result of his recent foray to <strong>Byss,</strong> the clones are to take care of him—quietly. These <strong>clone troopers</strong> have abandoned their usual white armor and instead have been garbed as escorts of Imperial nobility. However, thanks to a letter from a high-ranking member of the <strong>Imperial Senate,</strong> they have been granted special writ to carry their <em>blaster rifles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>4 @Actor[FtKM8fkyh7qUe1IZ]{Undercover Clone Troopers}</strong></p>\n<h4>Undercover Clone Trooper Tactics</h4>\n<p>The undercover <strong>clone troopers</strong> fight much like <strong>stormtroopers,</strong> ganging up on players. With the <strong>Theelin bodyguards</strong> protecting <strong>Baron Kithriss,</strong> the <strong>clone troopers</strong> are free to fight on the offensive. Though their <strong>attack bonuses</strong> are likely a little low to hit the players consistently, they will pair up on an individual player to ensure they at least land some shots.</p>\n<h4>Baron Kithriss</h4>\n<p>One of the new breed of Imperial nobles that dominates the <strong>Core worlds, Baron Kithriss</strong> is a Chandrilan noble who has become one of the Emperor’s greatest sycophants. In fact, he is so devoted to the Emperor that he was invited to a new, secret personal retreat on the <strong>Deep Core</strong> world of <strong>Byss.</strong> For <strong>weeks</strong>, <strong>Kithriss</strong> was the guest of <strong>Emperor Palpatine,</strong> but unknown to the <strong>Baron,</strong> the Emperor was secretly exposing him to a variety of <strong>Sith techniques</strong> intended to build up a resistance to <strong>Force powers.</strong> The conditioning will wear off in a matter of months, but while it lasts, the <strong>Baron’s</strong> loyalty to <strong>Palpatine</strong> will remain at zealous levels.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This handsome nobleman is young, barely more than 20 years old, but he carries himself with an air of superiority that befits a veteran member of the Imperial Senate. His dark black hair has been cut short in the new fashion favored by COMPNOR agents, though the rest of his garb suggests the latest fashions on Chandrila.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Baron Kithriss Tactics</h4>\n<p>Though <strong>Baron Kithriss</strong> possesses a limited amount of <strong>resistance</strong> to <strong>Force powers,</strong> he does not know it, and he will not rush to engage any players openly showing displays of <strong>Force.</strong> He prefers to let his <strong>bodyguards</strong> protect him while his <strong>clone troopers</strong> lead the way in the fight. He prefers to make <strong>attacks</strong> against players who are in minimal <strong>cover,</strong> in the hope of being able to use his <strong>Inspire Fervor</strong> reaction on one of the <strong>clone troopers.</strong> If any players get too close, he switches to using his <em>vibrorapier.</em> If he is confident in his ability to strike that player, he will <strong>attack</strong> them, though against players with a high <strong>AC,</strong> he will switch to taking the <strong>Dodge</strong> action to boost his chances of not being hit and let his <strong>bodyguards</strong> deal with the player instead.</p>\n<h4>Theelin Bodyguards</h4>\n<p>Identical <strong>twin sisters,</strong> these two near-Human bodyguards are devoted to the protection of <strong>Baron Kithriss.</strong> Though he calls them his <strong>“</strong><em>hired guards,</em>” in truth <strong>Kithriss</strong> purchased them as slaves from a Hutt gangster some years ago. Members of the <strong>Theelin</strong> near-Human species, these <strong>bodyguards</strong> boast a somewhat startling appearance which helps them take the attention off of the <strong>Baron.</strong> Like many slaves, they have been cowed by years of abuse, and go about their duty of protecting <strong>Kithriss</strong> with impassionate efficiency.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>This startling-looking woman resembles a Human but has a shock of bright orange hair. A pattern of spots runs from her neck down across her arms, and she moves with a grace that belies the slightly bulky armor she wears. Though a blaster rifle is slung over her shoulder, she looks as though she is ready to go for the vibrorapier swinging at her hip first.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>2 @Actor[2d60SvhOqq4yji4r]{Theelin Bodyguards}</strong></p>\n<h4>Theelin Bodyguard Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Theelin bodyguards</strong> are excellent close-quarters fighters, and though they are quite accurate with their <em>blaster rifles,</em> they really shine when the fight gets up close and personal. The <strong>Theelin bodyguards</strong> will use <strong>Intercept</strong> to divert <strong>attacks</strong> to themselves, relying on their <strong>AC.</strong> If any players get too close, a <strong>Theelin</strong> will try to grab one and trip him, allowing her comrade to slash down with her <em>vibrorapier</em> at the prone player. If no enemies are within melee range, the <strong>bodyguards</strong> use their blaster rifles, though they never stray too far from <strong>Baron Kithriss</strong> and always keep one of them adjacent to him.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the encounter ends, as long as the fight did not occur in an overtly public place, the players stand a good chance of escaping without having been seen by any local authorities. Even if someone did see the fight and alerted the <strong>Wing Guard,</strong> it will take <strong>several minutes</strong> for any guards to arrive, giving the players ample time to escape. However, given the number of people in <strong>Cloud City</strong> who want to avoid trouble with the law, it’s also possible that no one reported the fight at all (though with so many visitors in <strong>Cloud City</strong> for the <strong>sabacc tournament,</strong> this is unlikely).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p>The main avenues of <strong>Cloud City</strong> are usually free of debris, preferring an open-air aesthetic to highlight the beauty of a city in the clouds. As such, there is little to take cover behind during this encounter, and some players may find themselves far more exposed than they are accustomed to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Imperial%20Threats.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"736\" /></p>","folder":"aBQpachetSlGpNPc","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"s6AtjC2B6ljwyj2m","name":"Part 3: Skirmish Over Bespin <<>>","content":"<h1>Part 3: Skirmish Over Bespin</h1>\n<p>With the tournament over, the <strong>credits</strong> safe, and <strong>Silas Draver</strong> dealt with, the players have a chance to catch up to<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>. Having witnessed the transaction between the <strong>Imperial officer</strong> and <strong>Darga’s Hapan proxy</strong>, the players know that <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> has the information they need to find their quarry, and that she can likely reveal the full depth of <strong>Darga’s </strong>involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> was gravely wounded in the firefight with <strong>Silas Draver</strong> and his goons. With <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> dead and <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> on the edge of death, the players should waste no time in talking to her. She might be their last chance to learn <strong>Darga’s</strong> whereabouts.</p>\n<h2>Questioning Lady Fioro</h2>\n<p>Errant blaster bolts from <strong>Silas Draver’s</strong> attempted robbery caught <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> off guard, injuring her seriously. However, she is still conscious and able to answer questions. While <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot’s</strong> security team tries to clean up the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> the players have a few moments to interrogate <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> before the authorities arrive. She is weak and fading from consciousness, but all the fight has gone out of her. She doesn’t bother to deceive the players because she believes (perhaps rightly so) that she is only moments from death.</p>\n<p>Below are the answers to some questions that the players probably have for <strong>Lady Fioro:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who are you really?</strong> “<em>Mirana Fioro. I’m from Hapes, but I’m no noble. My father was a pirate, and he raised me aboard his ship. I’ve been pretending to be a noblewoman for years.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are you working for Darga the Hutt? </strong>“<em>Yes. I’ve been Darga’s agent for three years now. He instructed me to enter the tournament and take payment from the Imperial officer.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Where is Darga? </strong>“<em>In one of the lower docking bays on the underside of the city. Docking bay 4414. He’s been living on his luxury yacht, though now that he has the codes, I doubt he’ll be around for long. If he’s still in Cloud City within the hour, I’ll be surprised.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What was the code that Lt. Arandis transferred to you? </strong>“<em>It was the command codes for the slave circuit for a ship in orbit. A Gallofree Medium Transport. I sent the code to Darga just before the fight broke out. You’ve got to have a special computer to control it, but there’s one on board Darga’s yacht.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What is on that Medium Transport? </strong>“<em>Slaves, used in some secret Imperial project. Darga has been taking them as a partial payment from the Empire. They’re mostly decrepit and used up, but he resells them to other slavers from his palace on Cato Neimoidia.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What does Darga have to do with the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>I don’t know. I’ve only heard it mentioned. But for months now, he’s been trading huge amounts of Tibanna gas to the Empire in exchange for slaves and credits. The Empire always seems to want more.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uncovering the Worm</h2>\n<p>With information in hand about finding <strong>Darga</strong>, the players will likely set off to find the <strong>Hutt</strong> at last. Additionally, thanks to the information given to them by <strong>Mirana Fioro,</strong> the players also know the extent of <strong>Darga’s </strong>involvement with the Empire, and particularly altruistic players probably jump at the chance to free slaves of the Empire. However, <strong>Darga </strong>has also received word of the events that took place in the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> and he is taking no chances. The <strong>Hutt</strong> has ordered his belongings packed onto his yacht and is planning on taking off as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the players have survived and are likely coming for him, <strong>Darga </strong>pulls every string he has with the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> and instructs security personnel in his employ to keep the players from getting to his shuttle at all costs. As the players travel through the city trying to reach <strong>docking bay 4414,</strong> they are ambushed by <strong>Bespin security guards</strong> with Imperial loyalties. With the death of <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> a small contingent of <strong>stormtroopers</strong> and an <strong>Imperial officer</strong> remain in the city. <strong>Darga </strong>saw to it that they were informed of the players’ role in the <strong>Lieutenant’s</strong> death, and he has painted them as the villains behind the scheme.</p>\n<h2>Streets of Cloud City</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[TPeBw5GCgx7wNyge]{3-05 Streets of Cloud City}</strong></p>\n<p>When the players escape the ambush, they have very little time to reach <strong>docking bay 4414.</strong> They travel deeper into the city, and at their footsteps they often hear the sounds of pursuit. Occasionally, they hear shouts of “<em><strong>This way!</strong></em>” and “<em><strong>I think they’re heading down to a lower level!</strong></em>” echoing through the halls behind them. The muffled, electronic sound of the voices should indicate that a <strong>squad of stormtroopers</strong> remains in pursuit, dedicated to stopping the players from leaving <strong>Bespin</strong> alive.</p>\n<p>When they finally reach the docking bay they seek, they should realize that they are just in time. The <strong>Hutt</strong> and his minions are still outside of the ship, which looms large in the <strong>docking bay,</strong> and it looks as though they have been loading huge crates (filled with contraband that <strong>Darga</strong> picked up during his stay in <strong>Cloud City)</strong> onto the <strong>yacht.</strong> There is no time to talk. The Empire is at the players’ heels, and <strong>Darga’s goons</strong> know better than to wait for their boss to give the order to attack. With the <strong>Hutt</strong> shouting encouragement, Darga’s cronies and the <strong>stormtroopers</strong> try to put an end to the players’ meddling.</p>\n<h2>Hutt's Hanger</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[fKxFdraV4kLb55oT]{3-06 Hutt's Hanger}</strong></p>\n<h2>Covering the Empire's Track</h2>\n<p>Though his thugs have been defeated and the Empire is too far away to help, the Hutt <strong>crime lord</strong> is nonetheless defiant as he faces the players. Whether he is a prisoner or merely dying of his wounds, <strong>Darga </strong>cannot resist taunting the players one last time. Before he dies (or is otherwise subdued), <strong>Darga </strong>has a few choice words. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Darga gives a low groan and rolls his eyes before letting out a wheezing laugh. His words are almost dragged out of him, but despite this, he seems to be smiling that sickly Hutt smile that often graces his enormous face.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I should have killed you the first time you walked into my palace. You think you’ve done something right, but you’re gravely mistaken. At least those slaves would have lived if I’d sold them, but you’ve condemned them to die. The Empire won’t let them live on the chance that they might reveal the truth. The deaths of thousands will be on your hands!”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>The Arrival of the Assiduous</h2>\n<p>If the players used lethal force with <strong>Darga</strong>, he expires after delivering that coda. Otherwise, he simply refuses to speak further. Just moments after they finish with <strong>the Hutt</strong>, however, the players receive a call from <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> on the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em> According to her sensors, the Imperial I class Star Destroyer<strong> <em>Assiduous</em></strong> just emerged from hyperspace at the edge of the system and began transmitting extensive messages on the slave circuit to the <strong><em>Shackles of Nizon.</em></strong> It beamed similar messages to a <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> that had been sitting inert in the space above <strong>Bespin</strong> until now. As the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> launched a number of <strong>TIE fighters,</strong> all of which are screaming toward <strong>Bespin,</strong> the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> fired its engines and set in a new course—a course leading it directly at the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon.</strong></em> <strong>Crash</strong> has made the calculations, and the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> will collide with the <strong>Medium Transport</strong> in a <strong>matter of minutes</strong>, destroying both ships completely—and killing all the <strong>slaves</strong> on the <strong>Medium Transport.</strong></p>\n<h2>Stopping the Tibanna Gas Hauler</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> hauler is careening through space toward the <strong><em>Shackles of Nizon,</em></strong> a <strong>Medium Transport</strong> with thousands of <strong>slaves</strong> onboard. A group of <strong>TIE fighters</strong> is on its way toward <strong>Bespin,</strong> likely to finish the job in case the <strong>hauler</strong> doesn’t completely destroy the <strong>slave ship.</strong> The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is only <strong>minutes away</strong> from being in range of the planet, and the Empire knows the players are in <strong>Cloud City</strong> and were involved in the death of <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> (even if they weren’t directly responsible).</p>\n<p>Things look pretty dire for the players, and they may be tempted to cut their losses and make a break for it. However, <strong>thousands of slaves</strong> will die if they do. Moreover, those <strong>slaves</strong> are clearly involved in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> and stopping the <strong><em>Shackles of Nizon</em></strong> from being destroyed could give them another lead.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>hangar</strong> are <strong>six</strong> <strong>Z-95 headhunter starfighters </strong>that belonged to <strong>Darga the Hutt’s</strong> escorts. These ships, while not in pristine condition, are well maintained, powered up, and ready to fly. It actually takes very little skill to fly the ships (even an untrained pilot could maneuver them well enough), and<strong> high Intelligence</strong> characters are exceptionally good candidates to pilot the starfighters. Don’t be afraid to encourage the players to hop in the <strong>Headhunters;</strong> it will give individual players more to do during the <strong>final two encounters</strong> of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Another option for some of the players is to take command of <strong>Darga’s luxury yacht</strong>, the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot</strong></em>. This is a great chance for the players to get a ship of their own that they can use for the rest of the campaign, and could provide characters who aren’t great pilots with a chance to participate in the battle as gunners. Likewise, a few players could man the laser cannons aboard the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> while <strong>Okeefe</strong> and <strong>Crash</strong> pilot the transport. If some players want to take starfighters, a few want to steal the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot</strong></em>, and a few more want to act as gunners on the <em><strong>Banshee,</strong></em> that’s OK. It adds a bit of diversity to the last two encounters in the adventure, and it helps ensure that no characters are just “<strong>sitting in the ship</strong>” at the end. It takes <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> a few seconds to bring the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> around to pick the players up, and after that, they can blast off into the skies of <strong>Bespin</strong> together. The <em><strong>Glorious Chariot</strong></em> and <strong>Z-95 Headhunter</strong> stat's are below and use the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> stats from <strong>Dawn of Defiance Episode 1</strong>.)</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Z-95 Headhunter&gt;&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&lt;&lt;Glorious Chariot&gt;&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>As the players scream over <strong>Cloud City</strong> in their ships, members of the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> begin pursuit. Some have been ordered by the Empire to shoot down any ships attempting to leave <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and they pursue the players’ ships with lethal intent.</p>\n<h2>Flight from Cloud City</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peXsoGI6k3mmof70]{3-07 Flight from Cloud City}</strong></p>\n<p>Once the players get out of the atmosphere, they must contend with the forces of the Empire. Though the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is too far away to reach the Tibanna gas hauler, it has sent TIE fighters to make sure that the Shackles of Nizon is destroyed one way or another. When the players leave the atmosphere, they have only a limited amount of time to destroy the Tibanna gas hauler before it collides with the Shackles of Nizon.</p>\n<h2>Skirmish Over Bespin</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[XMDxAd30slZJU3UP]{3-08 Skirmish Over Bespin}</strong></p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>At the end of the adventure, assuming the players succeeded, the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> does not destroy the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>. A few short moments after the ship’s safety is assured, the players receive a simple text message from the <strong>Medium Transport:</strong> “<strong><em>We have gained control. Thank you.</em></strong>” The engines of the ship flare, and <strong>seconds later,</strong> it makes a jump to <strong>hyperspace,</strong> with no other fanfare.</p>\n<p>However, all is not safe in the <strong>Bespin</strong> system. The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is fast approaching, and the players definitely don’t want to stick around to answer a lot of questions from the Empire. While the navcomputers aboard the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> plot their course, the players can see the distant dagger shape of the Star Destroyer rapidly approaching their position. It becomes clear that the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> won’t be in range until well after the players have jumped to <strong>hyperspace,</strong> but the ship comes on nonetheless. Just before the players jump, they receive a visual communication from the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> (if they refuse to open a communications channel, the message can be sent as a recording to the <em><strong>Banshee,</strong></em> and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> can play it for them). Read the following text aloud when the players view the message:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The image on the screen resolves to show the bridge of the Star Destroyer <strong>Assiduous.</strong> Standing before the viewscreen is a darkly handsome man wearing long, flowing robes. The hilt of a lightsaber hangs from his belt.</em></p>\n<p><em>“My sensor operators tell me that your ship will be far enough from Bespin to jump to hyperspace before I can reach you. I congratulate you on your victory here, but know this: the Inquisitorius never rests. My name is Valin Draco, and I will find you and make you pay for meddling here. You may have bested that slimy Hutt, but I can assure you that the affections of an Inquisitor are not so gentle.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>End of the First Story Arc</h2>\n<p>The end of <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness </strong></em>concludes the first story arc in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign. By the end of this adventure, the players have learned that the Empire has been using slaves in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> and that they are in great need of large quantities of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> as well. They have seen <strong>Valin Draco,</strong> if at a distance, and now find themselves known to the Empire. When the players return to the Nebulon-B cruiser <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, they are welcomed by <strong>Captain Verana,</strong> who debriefs the players and seems amazed at all they were able to accomplish. He and his crew begin to analyze the data in the <em><strong>Banshee’s</strong></em> sensor systems that was brought back from <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> and <strong>Bespin,</strong> and they continue the search for the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> there.</p>\n<p>Similar to the gaps between the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> films, the end of this adventure provides a perfect time for you to take care of any lingering issues from the first third of the campaign. The players should be <strong>7th level</strong> by the time the adventure ends. If any of them are behind the curve, you can insert some small adventures of your own to help get them a little closer to the appropriate level.</p>\n<p>If any player characters died during<em><strong> The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>, the gap between adventures serves as a good place to introduce new characters. Additionally, if any of the players have goals to be taken care of during downtime—such as refurbishing the interior of the <strong><em>Glorious Chariot,</em></strong> installing special modifications to their ships, or constructing their own lightsabers—now is a good time to let those things happen. With the extremely fast pace of <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> adventures, it may be difficult to find time for more mundane activities during upcoming adventures.</p>\n<h2>Advancing the Campaign Timeline</h2>\n<p>One option you should consider is a large advancement in the campaign’s timeline. The gaps between many of the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> films leave months and even years unexplained, and doing the same for the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign could help not only make it feel more like the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> movies but also provide interesting options for character development. You can choose how far ahead to jump, though jumping forward more than <strong>two</strong> or <strong>three years</strong> can be troublesome. During that time period, the players continue to work for the <strong>Alderaanian Resistance,</strong> operating out of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, but getting no closer to the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> They have few major adventures, and characters might change significantly between <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em> and the fourth adventure in the campaign,<em><strong> Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em>. Just as Luke goes from being a Rebel pilot to a full-blown Jedi between <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em> and <em><strong>Return of the Jedi</strong></em>, a player might receive a major overhaul to help him or her fit in better with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>A large time jump also gives you the opportunity to allow a player to rebuild his or her character. Since the campaign began, the player might have found new options to try or might have learned that certain talents or feats weren’t used much. If you choose to let the player rebuild his character, he should keep the ability scores the same but otherwise can rebuild the character from the ground up, choosing new classes, talents, and feats. The player shouldn’t change too drastically and must remain recognizable, and the new statistics for the character should reflect a logical evolution. For example, rebuilding a Jedi as a scoundrel and not taking the <strong>Force Sensitivity feat</strong> is probably too big of a leap, but a scholar being rebuilt with fighter levels could reflect the player taking a larger role in the <strong>Alderaanian Resistance.</strong> You should work with your players to ensure that such changes make sense for the characters and provide new depth and story options for the players.</p>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

This adventure lets the players take part in the famous <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> (the same tournament in which, years later, <strong>Han Solo</strong> will win the <em><strong>Millennium Falcon</strong></em> from <strong>Lando Calrissian)</strong> and the players should advance to <strong>7th level</strong> by the end of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this adventure, the players will discover that there is more to this tournament than is apparent on the surface, and that it is being used to cover a transaction between <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> and the evil Galactic Empire. This adventure is the final part of the story arc that makes up the first chapter in the<strong> Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign. After the adventure, the players should have some much-needed downtime.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note from the Foundry Conversion Team:</strong> This adventure was written long before the story of <strong>Han</strong> and <strong>Lando</strong> was canonized on film. In <em><strong>Solo: A Star Wars Story</strong></em> we see that the card game actually took place on <strong>Numidian Prime.</strong> (The name of the planet comes from secondary materials, such as the novelization, but it clearly isn't <strong>Cloud City.)</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Adventure Background</h2>\n<p>This adventure is designed assuming that you have run your players through the first two <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>adventures, <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em> and <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>. The players should be familiar with <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> and know that he is involved with the Empire. The players should know he has been trading resources used for a clandestine Imperial operation known as the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The players also know that <strong>Darga </strong>has fled to the planet <strong>Bespin,</strong> and that finding him is the key to discovering more about the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p>If you aren’t running <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> but would like to use this adventure in your home campaign, the adventure can be adapted to get the players involved in other ways. The players might be hired by another crime lord to seek out <strong>Darga </strong>and figure out what he’s been doing with the Empire, or the players could be working for a law enforcement agency that believes that <strong>Darga </strong>is engaging in illegal activities with the Empire’s approval.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Summary</h4>\n<p>By the time the players arrive on <strong>Bespin,</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>is firmly secluded on <strong>Cloud City</strong>, and his luxury yacht is hidden. When the players begin their search for him, most of the usual avenues turn up nothing—the <strong>Hutt</strong> has paid his associates handsomely to keep him hidden, and none would jeopardize their health and wealth to reveal his location to anyone.</p>\n<p>The players’ only lead comes when they learn that <strong>Cloud City</strong> will be holding a major <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> in a matter of days, and that it is rumored that an <strong>Imperial officer</strong> will be arriving to participate. Rumor has it that this <strong>officer</strong> is in the pocket of<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>, and that his participation in the <strong>tournament</strong> is merely a cover-up for a clandestine meeting between them. If the players can infiltrate the card game, they might have a chance to question the <strong>Imperial officer</strong> or <strong>Darga’s </strong>agent about the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> whereabouts—but first they must get into the game, which is by invitation only. The <strong>tournament</strong> takes place and, if the players do well, they find themselves face-to-face with <strong>Darga’s </strong>agent.</p>\n<p>The players also discover that the reason for the <strong>officer’s</strong> visit was not only to play in the <strong>tournament</strong> but also to deliver payment for the biggest shipment of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> yet. In addition, the payment for the <strong>gas</strong> is unusual as well: the officer brought an entire transport ship full of <strong>slaves</strong> to trade to the <strong>Hutt.</strong> The vessel with the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> was launched before the <strong>tournament</strong> started, and the <strong>slave</strong> ship remains in orbit, having been brought to the system earlier.</p>\n<p>The players discover that <strong>Darga </strong>has been hiding in a hangar in the underside of <strong>Cloud City.</strong> When the players arrive, they face a combined force of <strong>Darga’s </strong>minions and a small detachment of Imperial <strong>stormtroopers</strong>. <strong>Darga </strong>makes a stand and engages the players in combat (or at least, his minions do, while the <strong>Hutt</strong> prods them from the back of the chamber). After <strong>Darga</strong> is defeated, the players learn that the Empire has set the cruiser carrying <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> on a collision course with the slave ship, eliminating the two biggest pieces of evidence of their deal, which has now gone sour thanks to the players’ intervention.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the players still have a chance to stop the collision. Inside the hangar are a number of brand-new <strong>Z-95 Headhunter starfighters,</strong> and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> arrives within moments to pick up any players who do not wish to fly their own <strong>starfighters.</strong> As they reach low orbit, the players can see the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> carrier blazing toward the slave ship. Unfortunately, the dagger-shaped form of a <strong>Star Destroyer </strong>appears out of hyperspace bearing down on the players. The players must race to destroy the ship carrying the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> before it can crash into the slave ship, fending off <strong>TIE fighters</strong> at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ouAd7mWOxoy4njlK]{Opening Crawl}</p>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"uKInL7wS2vTCvxGv","name":"4-01 Seeing Red","content":"<h2>Seeing Red</h2>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>The fight starts with the heroes on one side and the <em><strong>Blood Brother</strong></em> with its <strong>4 Z-95 Headhunter</strong> escorts. If the heroes' ship has been boarded, combat takes place in an interior portion of the ship. Otherwise, it takes place as a space battle between the <em><strong>Blood Brother</strong></em> and any ships possessed by the heroes. If there are more than <strong>4 players </strong>in the campaign, consider increasing the amount of <strong>Z-95 Headhunters</strong> to match.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>As soon as the heroes spot the <strong>pirate vessel</strong> in orbit, their ship’s subspace transceiver pings, and an image appears on their viewscreen:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the ruby-dipped consular-class cruiser fills the viewport, suddenly on your ship’s viewscreen, in all his preposterous glory, is a pointy-eared, male near-Human with thick, flaring eyebrows, a patch of fur on his jutting chin, and a razor-thin mustache that would be the envy of any holodrama villain. He’s wearing an open crimson blouse, strapped down at the waist by a gold sash, and he brandishes a menacing vibrorapier. His gloating smile says it all.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Let’s not waste time, you starforsaken spawns of space slugs,” the man says. “By the authority of the Red Fury Brotherhood, you’re now Captain Reddjak’s prisoners.

Prepare for the pleasure of being boarded.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>&lt;&lt;\"The Blood Brother\"&gt;&gt;</strong></em></p>\n<h4>Blood Brother Tactics</h4>\n<p><strong>Reddjak</strong> would like to be able to claim the heroes’ cargo as booty by boarding their ship, and if the heroes are caught by the <strong>Blood Brother’s</strong> tractor beam they may have no choice. However, he’s already receiving a handsome compensation from <strong>Inquisitor Draco,</strong> so <strong>Reddjak</strong> will not hesitate to blast the heroes’ ship into smithereens if they struggle.</p>\n<p>A ship is only as effective as its <strong>captain,</strong> and <strong>Reddjak</strong> is both overconfident and anxious to make a name for himself, making the <strong>Blood Brother</strong> vulnerable to hero ingenuity. The first thing <strong>Reddjak</strong> does is try to get a <strong>tractor beam</strong> lock on the heroes. If they try to escape, he aims to disable their ships. If the heroes flee, a pair of the <strong>Blood Brother’s</strong> <strong>Z-95 headhunters</strong> gives chase to the planet below, again taking aim at the heroes’ engines and trying to force them to land.</p>\n<p><strong>4 @Actor[9GHE6q0UwN12ntbS]{Z-95 Headhunters}</strong></p>\n<h4>Red Fury Pirates</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Red Fury Brotherhood</strong> is as cutthroat as they come. <strong>Reddjak</strong> has taken on many violent outcasts and turned the alien pariahs into stonehearted killers. These corsairs are trained to board in space with space suits or force their victims onto a planet surface where they can fight in the open. Complete with <em>cybernetic eye patches</em>, <em>vibrorapiers, blasters,</em> and a stench that could bowl over a bantha, these pirates are seasoned pros, anxious to loot their first catch of the day.</p>\n<p>These are pirates from straight out of the holodramas. Dressed in red and swinging <em>vibrorapiers,</em> they stink of Corellian ale and other unknown substances. The only thing missing is a cry of “Ahoy, mateys!” This motley collection of individuals flash their stained teeth as they start shooting at you.</p>\n<p><strong>4 &lt;&lt;Red Fury Pirates&gt;&gt;</strong></p>\n<h4>Red Fury Pirate Tactics</h4>\n<p>Unless the heroes voluntarily open the cargo door for the boarders, the <strong>pirates</strong> make their own entrance with a <em>fusioncutter</em> or similar device. They initially try to stun the heroes, hoping to capture them and sell them as slaves, but the boarders switch tactics to shoot to kill as soon as anyone in their party gets injured.</p>\n<p>Each pirate is carrying <strong>600 credits</strong> while <strong>Reddjak</strong> carries <strong>1,000 credits</strong> for a total of <strong>3,400 credits</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the heroes defeat the <strong>Red Fury pirates</strong>, they can take time to survey the damage to their ship and repair it if they have a mechanic.

{"_id":"gUZAw2YVmoEDlLwu","name":"Part 1: Mission to Almas","content":"<h1>Part 1: Mission to Almas</h1>\n<p>Before starting the adventure, you should bring the players up to speed about what their characters have been doing since the end of <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>. Afterward, read the following text aloud to them. It takes place in a briefing room aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, where <strong>Master Denia</strong> briefs the heroes on a new mission.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"“Your help to our cause in the last few months has been invaluable and your dedication exemplary. During my recovery, I had time to reflect on our goal—to discover the purpose of the Sarlacc Project.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While studying at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, I learned about holocrons—recording devices into which Jedi stored their wisdom to pass on to future generations. Some holocrons, such as the prized Tedryn Holocron of Jedi Master Ashka Boda, were tailored toward helping Jedi Masters penetrate the secrets of the <strong>Force.</strong> Even beings already trained in the Jedi ways, like myself, greatly benefit from such a source of learning.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I summoned you because the <strong>Force</strong> has pulled together threads of knowledge to reveal the location of a holocron similar to the Tedryn. Some time before I traveled to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, Master Ashka Boda contacted me with news that he had joined the former Almas Academy student Halagad Ventor in trying to form a network between the scattered Jedi survivors of the destruction of the academy. During the Clone Wars, an orbital bombardment decimated the academy in the Cularin system, and if any artifacts have survived, common sense suggests that they have since been stolen. But the <strong>Force</strong> tells me that the holocron we require is there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I’ve never been to the planet Almas in person, but I knew the headmaster there, a serene Jedi Master named Lanius Qel-Bertuk. I have no current information on the planet, but I can provide you with coordinates and a path through the treacherous comet cloud that surrounds the Cularin system. These were obtained at great expense thanks to <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> vast connections.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I feel this is crucial to our cause, because I have sensed a link between the Sarlacc Project and the slaves that you rescued above <strong>Bespin</strong>. But I have probed the <strong>Force</strong> tirelessly and at last reached my limits. With this Jedi holocron, however, I might expand my ability to see through the <strong>Force</strong> and find the answers we seek. Furthermore, I will be able to pass on the lessons it contains to a future generation of Jedi, thus coming one step closer to restoring peace and justice to the galaxy.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The coordinates to Cularin are programmed into the nav computer of the heroes' ship, which should be consulted for additional information about the system. If the heroes have more questions before the mission starts, you should clarify or repeat only what <strong>Master Denia</strong> already told them. Don’t reveal too much, aside from what the player's <strong>Intelligence (Lore) checks</strong> entitle them to know about Almas. The trip takes approximately <strong>one day</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ALMAS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Region: Expansion Region</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Climate: Desolate wasteland, temperate kaluthin grasslands (high oxygen)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gravity: Normal</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Moons: 1 (Dorumaa)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Length of Day: 38 standard hours</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Length of Year: 5,547 local days</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sapient Species: 66% Human, 14% Tarasin, 20% other species</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Government: None</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Capital: Forard (Abandoned)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Major Exports: None</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Major Imports: None</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Intelligence (Nature)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC10 On the opposite side of the planet from the city is a vast wasteland where no kaluthin has grown for <strong>two hundred years</strong>. This dead zone is cold and lifeless, and full environment suits are required to survive in it. The area has grown steadily for centuries and now has reached the academy’s doorstep</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC15 In the heart of the wasteland is an ancient Sith fortress, which was abandoned about a<strong> thousand years ago</strong>. The wasteland has grown at an estimated radius of <strong>3 feet per year</strong>, though the death of kaluthin was further accelerated recently, starting about <strong>13 years ago</strong> with sabotage by a dark side cult called the Believers. Since the razing of the Almas Academy, however, a radical surge in the dead zone has occurred. The wasteland now encompasses a radius of 3,100 miles, with a trail that leads straight to the ghost town of Forard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC20 It is rumored that the Sith Lord who built the fortress around <strong>1,150</strong> to <strong>1,400 years ago</strong> also created the kaluthin, combining his knowledge of bioengineering with the power of the <strong>Force.</strong> The kaluthin ability to synthesize the atmosphere of an entire planet is still considered an amazing achievement today. Until recently, scientists researched ways of transplanting the glowing grass to other worlds, but met with little success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Intelligence (Lore)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 10 Almas is the fourth and outermost planet in the Cularin system. Over a <strong>thousand years ago</strong>, a plant named kaluthin took root on the icy, lifeless world, nourishing itself from large underground lakes. Over time, the kaluthin synthesized the planet’s poisonous atmosphere (composed in large part of methane and phosphorus) into enough oxygen to sustain carbon-based life. Still, prolonged exposure can be hazardous to one's health due to trace amounts of toxins, and breath masks or atmospheric regulators are strongly recommended.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 15 The local nights on Almas are not determined by the distant twin suns. Wherever kaluthin grow (everywhere except in the dead zone), their phosphorus-filled leaves absorb the moonlight and make the surface of the planet glow. It takes a while for newcomers to adjust to the dusk to dawn cycles, which are determined by the kaluthin’s leaves being either spread open or closed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 20 A century and a half ago, the Jedi established a training academy on Almas. The town of Forard was subsequently built, forming a circle around the Jedi academy. Several sadrin farms were found wherever kaluthin grew. All were recently abandoned, however, shortly after the academy was destroyed. Now the academy ruins and the surrounding town buildings are regularly despoiled by salvagers looking for valuable loot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 25 The academy was attacked at the end of the Clone Wars by three starships, which took the resident Jedi by surprise. One was a Cularin Allied Force ship that was brought down by Jedi starfighters and crashed into the academy grounds. Another was a mercenary vessel destroyed by allies of the Jedi. The third was a black starfighter that fled shortly after the assault, possibly carrying the party responsible for the attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes exit hyperspace, read the following text aloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Several hours after leaving the Corellian Run, your starship exits hyperspace at the calculated point just outside the Cularin system. Exactly as you were warned by <strong>Master Denia</strong>, you notice innumerable comets of all shapes and sizes occasionally colliding with each other, forming an enormous cloud around the system. Fortunately, you were supplied with a sensor package that analyzes their erratic patterns and calculates a safe path through the cloud. Once past that danger, another jump must be calculated to avoid flying for <strong>weeks</strong> at sublight speeds. However, this time the calculations are trickier due to large, overlapping gravity wells created by the system’s dense planet cores. But you know people who’ve made the Kessel Run, and this can’t be worse than skirting the Maw cluster. An hour later, you again emerge from hyperspace and the planet farthest from Cularin’s twin suns comes into view, lambent and mysterious: Almas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first thing you notice from orbit is the strange luminescence that emanates from the planet itself. The twin suns are too distant to illuminate the planet, and you are approaching from the side facing away from them. Yet most of the surface emits a faint glow, except for one dark spot where the Jedi academy happens to be located according to your nav computer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ALMAS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As soon as they near Almas, the heroes’ starship sensors start beeping, alerting them to a nearby ship. A modified consular-class cruiser was hiding in orbit close to planet’s moon Dorumaa and is now coming at them fast, with cannons and tractor beams trained on the heroes’ ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since the destruction of the Almas Academy, the pirates of the Red Fury Brotherhood emerged as the dominant corsairs in the Cularin system. Inquisitor Draco cut a deal to have them patrol the orbit of Almas while he investigates the darkness saturating the planet. Policing duties have fallen to one of the Red Fury’s most hardhearted and arrogant swashbucklers, the pirate Reddjak. His menacing scarlet vessel, the Blood Brother, tries to ensnare and board the heroes’ ship within moments of its arrival.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SEEING RED</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LANDING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nav computer instructs the heroes to land near the abandoned cluster of buildings formerly comprising the city of Forard. There is no spaceport control to direct them—the landing beacons have been extinguished for close to <strong>two years.</strong> Landing the ship is not difficult, since the terrain around the town is flat for hundreds of miles. However, if the ship was damaged during the “Seeing Red” encounter, the heroes should make a few <strong>Intelligence (PIloting) checks</strong> to land without incident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ship’s sensors detect only a few life forms in the vicinity. The planet’s atmosphere is cold and has a very high oxygen concentration. The air contains traces of toxins (such as methane and phosphorus), and a <strong>DC 15 Survival check </strong>reveals that the heroes should wear breath masks, at least while outside the ruins, to avoid being affected.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they ignore this warning or fail the <strong>Survival check,</strong> have the players make a <strong>DC 15 Constitution saving throw,</strong> if they fail they take <strong>[[/r 2d8[poison] # Poison damage]] damage</strong> and take one level of exhaustion from the toxic atmosphere. In addition, due to the large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere, players regain all their hit dice upon a long rest instead of only half.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The academy ruins are located in the city center, and since kaluthin doesn’t grow in the immediate vicinity, the heroes must use glowrods (or ignited lightsabers) to light the way. Heroes who are <strong>force sensitive </strong>automatically detect a strong presence of the dark side as soon as they get just over half a mile towards the academy. Due to the dark side interference, the Affect Mind, Mind Trick and <strong>Sense Emotion force</strong> <strong>powers</strong> do not function.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SQUIBS . . . WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE SQUIBS?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nearly circular city of Forard escaped the fate of the Jedi academy around which it was built. Citizens of the urban sprawl watched in horror and awe as fire rained down from the sky with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, utterly annihilating the academy. But if the people thought they were safe after this precision strike, they were dead wrong. With the destruction of the academy, a series of mysterious calamities befell the city, and now it remains all but lifeless.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whether the heroes land in this area as part of the encounter with the Red Fury Brotherhood or come to it afterward, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city is empty of men, women, and children. Hostile winds whip through the lifeless streets and between the alleyways of abandoned buildings. Unlike most of the planet, here the unchecked kaluthin has taken over, growing up to 6 feet tall in some parts of the city. And yet, the plant fails to mask strewn debris and the occasional decomposing body—the calling cards of looters and bandits who plundered the city after the unexpected attack almost <strong>two years ago.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you walk through the discarded remnants of old lives, you notice the empty twin buildings housing the local children’s school. To your left, you see faded graffiti on the wall, below a sign that reads “Remembrance Hall.” A collective chill runs down your spines as you make out suspiciously red letters that say, “DEATH TO THE UNFAITHFUL.\" When you get within a 300 feet of the academy ruins, you realize that all the kaluthin inside this radius has died off. This area is as dead as the entire planet was millennia ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a hero makes a successful<strong> DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> with <strong>disadvantage,</strong> they notice that they are being watched, though he can’t determine who or what is spying on them. He catches only shadows or overhears noises of jostled metal and debris. These are Sith worshippers and their Dark Lizard pets that, up until the bombardment, had relegated themselves to Almas’ Sith fortress and its immediate vicinity, where the lingering presence of the dark side used to be strongest. The heroes will encounter a pack of Dark Lizards before entering the Almas Academy and the Sith “Believers” later within the ruins’ obscured depths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes make their way to the city center, they reach the outer buildings that surround the Almas Academy—or what used to be the academy (see the map of the academy area on page 11). Extrapolated from the Coruscant Jedi Temple’s original design, only a few crumbling walls of the Jedi learning center are still visible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes near what might have been the entrance to the academy grounds, a cacophony of barely intelligible voices assails their ears. When the heroes get even closer, they spot three rotund beings in space suits towering over five aliens that look like rabid canines with blue fur. A member of each group is engaged in a tug-of-war over what looks like the upper half of a tarnished silver protocol droid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Ged your unholy pseudopoda off dis Holy Artifact, Zquib-thing,” the big one says.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The little guy retorts, “From our dead, cold paws, ugly Ugor fiend-being! We did the location finding of this silver-ish, prettisome treasure pre-secondary!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“It is unfortunate,” the half-droid says, “that Jedi Master Lanius never programmed me for a denouement of this particular design.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Hey, byu!” One of larger ones yells, popping off its helmet and turning part of its flabby amoebic body into an arm to wave you over “Hey byu, tell Zquib zinners we find dis Holy Artifact infinitely dimes infinitely before dem. Blease!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Scavengers. Given the scum that usually shows up in the wake of a battle or planetary catastrophe, these foragers seem relatively harmless. This should be evident to the heroes based on the exchanges they overhear. Based on the droid’s reference to his relationship with Jedi Master Lanius (whom <strong>Master Denia</strong> mentioned to the heroes), they should realize that the droid might have information that can help them with their mission. If the heroes do not catch on immediately, feel free to offer them other incentives to recover the droid for themselves, such as having the droid mention knowledge of the academy’s ruins (“This never would have happened if I’d stayed in the ruins!”) and so forth. When the heroes approach, all parties react with a degree of restrained but visible hope, each trying to share its side of the story before the others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SplrMuck, the unicellular Ugor holding the droid’s left arm, explains that his group found the droid first, fair and square, dragging it out from the Almas Academy ruins. SplrMuck set the droid down in front of the academy entrance for just a second when he saw the heroes’ ship set down nearby. SplrMuck’s story, if true, seems to be news to Jiminaldomabbramsti (or Jimi)—the feisty Squib with a death grip on the droid’s right arm—and his furry compatriots. They work for the Squib salvager Squeerie, and Jimi insists that no Ugors were around at the time he found this “treasure” near the temple entrance. Possession is ninehundred-and-ninety-nine one-thousandths of High Squibbian Law, so if SplrMuck set the droid down, for whatever reason, it’s fair game. By contrast, Ugors have turned garbage gathering into a religion, and Ugorian Divine Law decrees that the first being to find a piece of junk consecrates it with his slime on contact, a mark of ownership instantly identifiable and respected by any other Ugor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As for the half-droid himself, he explains respectfully that he is 7A39, or SevenAy, a former protocol droid for the Almas Academy. The heroes should not only feel inclined toward helping the hapless droid, but also recognize that SevenAy might have crucial information about the academy’s sublevels and perhaps the holocron they’re after.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have multiple challenges in their interactions with the scavengers, but only acquiring SevenAy or a special datacron is critical to the success of their mission. The heroes must negotiate with the Squib and Ugor parties for the droid. The following challenges show how the heroes can affect the outcome of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: The heroes must either save 7-A39 so that they can question the protocol droid or obtain a datacron that will grant access to the computer inside the academy's control room. Although the scavengers begin the encounter hostile toward each other, each group begins with an attitude of indifferent toward the heroes, whom they hope can solve their dilemma. As both groups are really less interested in SevenAy than in getting as many credits as they can, they are receptive to any deal the heroes try to spin in exchange for the droid. If pressed, SplrMuck will give up his claim to SevenAy for 2,000 credits, and Jimi will settle for any spare breath masks the heroes might have (the Squibs didn’t realize that the Almas atmosphere was technically poisonous). Once the heroes have acquired SevenAy, the Squibs throw in a net, free of charge, so that one of the heroes can carry the half-droid on his or her back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the characters don’t barter for SevenAy, the datacron can be used instead to splice into the academy’s computer. However, the datacron won’t offer the same advice that SevenAy can. The droid has intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the academy, even after the attacks, and can provide directions and explanations of how some systems inside the academy work—for example, that the backup generator can power only one sublevel at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: In addition to obtaining components for their ship, the heroes can haggle with the scavengers for other items. The Squibs have the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a battering ram</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a box of eight glowrods</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a beat-up children’s holobook of Busteromuchmacho and the Vermillion Shadow (Vol. 3 in the Squib Jedi series)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a broken lightsaber that belonged to Dorv'Tilsta, the Padawan of Master Vhiin’Thorla, which will be of use to the heroes later</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Ugors have these items:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a clone trooper utility belt (with a medpac and 50 ft of Fibercord cable)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a Stokhli spray stick (identifiable with a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a “holy holocron”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes show excitement over the holocron, the Ugors demand, in exchange, either a sizeable sum (5,000 credits) or something precious to the heroes. If the characters acquire the holocron, they quickly realize that it’s a “holocron” in name only—a cheap marketing ploy used to boost the appeal of everyday datacrons. If the Ugors allow the heroes to inspect the “holocron” before sealing the deal, a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (technology) check</strong> reveals that it is fake.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: Finally, the heroes should try to resolve the scavengers’ dispute peacefully, a successful <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check </strong>results in apologies from both sides for the misunderstanding. Give the players <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check</strong> if they attempt to get the Squib and Ugor parties to understand each other’s sacred laws. If the heroes anger one or both sides, they fail the challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ad-Hoc XP Award: If the heroes successfully resolve the Squib-Ugor dispute, award them XP as though they had defeated a CR 6 encounter</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STOTKLI SPRAY STICK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Weapon (electrostaff), prototype (requires attunement)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Originally created by the nomadic Stokhli species on the planet Manress, Stokhli spray sticks served as effective long-range stun weapons, and were first employed for big game hunting. These weapons had enough power to knock out large animals like gundarks, making them very popular among big-game hunters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You gain a <strong>+1 bonus</strong> to <strong>attack</strong> and <strong>damage rolls</strong> made with this weapon and this electrostaff's shocking DC increases from 13 to 15.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, this electrostaff comes with an integrated net launcher, the net launcher has a minimum range of 60ft and a maximum of 240ft, a reload of 5, and uses traditional power cells as ammunition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained and shocked until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a <strong>DC 13 Strength check</strong>, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 20 hit points, immunity to all <strong>damage</strong> not dealt by melee weapons, and <strong>resistance</strong> to <strong>damage</strong> dealt by unenhanced melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net’s effects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Squibs are small, furry humanoids with tufted ears. Their fur ranges from deep red to brilliant blue, and they have large yellow or red eyes. They are known for their fearless curiosity, shameless overconfidence, and love of haggling. They are enthusiastic scavengers, and often find fistfuls of credits in the detritus that others discard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ugors are single-celled beings. However, that single cell grows to be 6 feet across. An Ugor can extrude as many as thirty distinct pseudopodia, which serve as limbs, manipulators, or sensory organs. Ugors often have a “default” appearance, roughly humanoid, to deal with multicelled beings. Ugors see scavenging as their business and their religion. They are often selfish, unfriendly by nature, and concerned only with garbage and food. Lying and cheating are Ugor virtues, and they are highly competitive with Squibs, whom they consider their mortal enemies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SALVAGER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Squib or Ugor), lawful neutral</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (fiber armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 33 (6d8+6)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 14 (+2) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Investigation +4, Lore +4, Technology +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 10</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic and Squib or Ugor</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Techcasting.

The heroes’ only warning before the assault is a spine-chilling snarl and SplrMuck’s gurgling vociferation, “Holy irrebducible garbágina!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE BELIEVERS' PETS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the scavengers were receptive to the heroes before, they consider the heroes comrades now that they have shed dark side blood together. After killing the Dark Lizards, if the heroes had not already secured the items they wanted from the scavengers, the Squibs and Ugors turn them over with glee—at a meager 50 credits each. There’s nothing they wouldn’t do for a friend, after all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes have secured their prize (either the half-droid or the datacron), they can head directly into the Almas Academy ruins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTERING THE RUINS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do some reconnaissance outside, they can see that the ruins of eight rectangular buildings surround the tower like ragged teeth. The grounds between them and the main building used to be gardens, but are now littered with ferrocrete hunks of blasted wall and the remains of a military ship that crashed into the north side of the tower. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Soon, you pass the outer buildings and grounds that surround the academy proper. The remains of the circular structure are immediately identifiable as Coruscani in design. The majestic white marble tower lies toppled on the ground.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once you pass the yawning entrance, where the 16 foot-high double doors were ripped from their hinges by someone who valued only their material worth, you find yourselves in the entry hall. Even with all the surrounding devastation, the wonder of this place remains palpable. The few interior walls still standing are also made of white Selonian marble, lined with thick veins of silver that form into knots where wall and floor meet. Inlaid cases carved into the entry hall walls are set at about 3 feet off the floor. Dust-free spots inside them show that their contents were stolen rather recently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Only some sections of the ground floor remain accessible. Most of the corridors were blocked when the upper floors caved in during the bombardment. You must make your way over or under a row of once-dazzling columns at the hall center, now shattered into pathetic fragments. At the other end, past the cracked bust of a venerable Twi’lek Jedi, the only unobstructed path leads to the fountain chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once there, you find yourselves in a large, circular room, half of which is completely caved in. There are five marble benches lined up along the curving wall on the left and an exit at the other end, which leads to another dark corridor. While the farthest half is filled with debris, in the middle of the room sits a magnificent fountain. From its center extends an impressive sculpture of a large humanoid hand, palm out in a welcoming gesture. The work of art is cracked from the impacts it suffered during the <strong>attack.</strong> The fountain waters stopped bubbling a long time ago, and at the bottom of the dried-up pool is a dark, viscous substance that seems to slightly alter its shape. Must be a trick of the light. There seems to be nothing of interest in this former contemplation chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes go directly to the exit, skip to the next encounter. If at least one hero tries to touch the black substance, add the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you approach the black substance that lies at the center of the fountain, a tendril of ooze lashes out faster than the eye can see, and a profound cold engulfs you for a second. Before anyone realizes what has happened, the puddle of ooze disappears down the fountain water shaft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each hero in a square that is adjacent to the ooze is <strong>attacked</strong> by one tendril. The <strong>attack</strong> is considered a <strong>surprise attack</strong> and cannot act in response. Have any adjacent players make a <strong>DC 17 Dexterity saving throw</strong> and deals <strong>[[/r 1d8[psychic] # Psychic damage]] damage</strong>. The creature is a t’salak and will be encountered in the lower levels of the academy. It has been lying in wait as a sort of sentry, but it doesn’t use its <strong>powers</strong> on the heroes just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CAVE-IN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The right path on the ground floor is pretty clear-cut. The holomap contained within SevenAy or the datacron is useful only once the heroes reach the sublevels. Still, if the heroes ask, the droid reveals that the inaccessible rooms on the ground floor used to be offices and classrooms, the lightsaber training room, and the grand lecture hall. The only way downstairs is via an empty turbolift shaft located past the fountain chamber and to the left. But before they reach it, the heroes’ passing causes a wall to cave in—a wall that was sustaining the ceiling by a hairpin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The falling debris causes the players to make a<strong> DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong> deals <strong>[[/r 4d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> with a successful <strong>save</strong> taking<strong> half damage</strong>. Any hero who fails the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> gets caught beneath a lump of ferrocrete. A successful <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check </strong>will remove the debris.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes survive, they reach the turbolift shaft. It shows signs of recent activity, and heroes who make a <strong>DC 19 Wisdom (Survival) check </strong>will know that there were several humanoids who passed through here. If they succeed in a <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> they also know that it was only in the past <strong>few days</strong>. There are no handholds inside the shaft. To descend, the heroes must climb down or use an item such as a fibercord rope. The turbolift shaft descends for <strong>50 feet</strong> before reaching the first sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Note, surviving the cave in and entering the first sublevel of the Academy should be considered a level-up milestone.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: DOMAIN OF EVIL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the ruined ground floor above had at least some reflected light streaming in, the underground level is pitch black. As the heroes scurry down the empty shaft, they must rely on their own darkvision, glowrods, lightsabers or other sources of light to guide the way. Beneath the heroes is a rubble pile that fell inside the shaft, blocking the path north to the vehicle hangar, but the south exit out of the turbolift is clear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once outside the lift shaft, the heroes find themselves at the intersection of two corridors that form an “L” shape (see the map of sublevel 1). A thin coat of dust covers the floor, disturbed in places where several beings have recently traveled. The walls are constructed of reinforced white duraplast. The corridor going east leads to several small study chambers and the remains of a control room, before being blocked by a cave-in (see “Control Room,” below). The corridor going straight (south) has two blast doors (see “Generator Room,” below) and turns left about 75 feet down (see “Library,” below).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONTROL ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All meditation chambers (each about 10 feet wide by 25 feet long) are empty, so the main feature of this northern area is the control room. There is no power to this level, so the blast door must be opened manually. Heroes can jury-rig an external power source (such as a datapad or power cell) on a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. They can also pry open the door on a <strong>DC 20 Strength check </strong>or simply break it down (AC 15, 18 hit points). If the heroes enter the control room, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The blast door yields, and you find yourselves in a dark, dank room about 10 feet by 60 feet. On the opposite wall is a large, cracked transparisteel window with a view blocked by enormous boulders and slag. The far side of the room is also filled from floor to ceiling with rubble where the wall and window were not strong enough to hold back the collapsing academy structure. Below the window is a bank of consoles and computers; some have been damaged, with broken screens and severed wires hanging from underneath. But one console seems intact. It has a standard input for datapads and astromech droids.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes might have turned on the power to this level (see “Generator Room,” below). If not, they can power up the console with an external source on a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. If 7-A39 is with them, the droid suggests it to the heroes. If the <strong>check</strong> fails by <strong>5 or more</strong>, the console short-circuits and requires extensive repairs. If the <strong>check</strong> succeeds, the computer turns on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the Jedi had locked down the system with restricted access, so the heroes have to plug in either SevenAy (at his suggestion), the datacron they obtained from the Ugors or perform a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. The information that can be accessed includes a map of sublevel 1, descriptions of functions for each room (the most important of which is the library), and a dated log showing what vehicles were borrowed from the hangar (located behind the debris-blocked window) and by whom.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Access to the map shows a stairway leading down at the end of the corridor outside the control room, but the heroes noticed earlier that this route is blocked. They must circle the perimeter of the meditation rooms and arrive at the other side of the blocked passageway to access these stairs (unknown to the heroes, that stairway is also blocked by debris; see “Storage Rooms,\" below). The last log entry, dated around the same time as the attack on the Almas Academy, shows that all vehicles were evacuated from the hangar due to an emergency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To access information about the second sublevel, the heroes must succeed at a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. (See the map of sublevel 2 on page 19. Draw a version of the map that has no labels, and show it to the players.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can issue routine commands, such as turning on the power and opening unlocked blast doors, for either sublevel, but they can do so for only one sublevel at a time. If they turn on the power, the ceiling lights flicker on in the corridor outside. However, the lights are very dim and strobe unpredictably. Be sure to describe this phenomenon to unnerve the heroes as they move about the sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GENERATOR ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halfway across the corridor, on the west side wall, are two blast doors. If the heroes turned on the power in the control room, the doors whisk open with the push of a button. If not, they need to be powered up using an external source or forced (see “Control Room,” above). Behind both doors, the rooms are of equal size, roughly 20 feet by 50 feet at its largest points. The first room used to be a repair and maintenance area. Salvagers have picked it clean, but some pieces of junk are still lying around, including empty fuel containers, damaged repair tools, and all kinds of nuts, bolts, and hull plates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second room houses the academy’s power generator, a huge cylindrical turbine. Close inspection reveals that it is damaged beyond salvation. A smaller turbine nearby is the backup generator, and it is mostly intact. It can be powered on from the computer in the control room or by connecting a datapad directly to it and issuing the activation commands. The backup generator has only enough juice to power one level of the academy at a time, and since the top floors no longer exist, the heroes can use it to power one of the two sublevels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once activated, the backup generator will run for <strong>six hours</strong> before shutting down for a recharge. But the heroes won’t know this, so you can surprise them with this fact once the approximate time has lapsed (or at any particularly dramatic moment). The largely empty room also has a functioning repulsor sled, which the heroes can use to haul their gear around or as a battering ram to beat down doors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIBRARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The southern corridor parallels the one to the north, where the control room is located, except that it is not blocked by debris. This corridor is 110 feet long. Along its left (north) wall are numerous doors that lead to more meditation rooms, and in the center of the opposite (south) wall is a single door. The heroes can ignore the doors, swing left around the outside of the meditation chambers, and go directly toward the stairwell (see “Storage Rooms,\" page 14). Each meditation room is 10 feet by 25 feet and totally empty aside from a few personal effects, now caked with dust, that were left behind in a hurry. These inexpensive items (not worth more than 5 credits) might include a personal groomer, a planetary landscape holo-mag, and a recording rod loaded with relaxing music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most important area of sublevel 1 is the library, located directly across from the southern meditation rooms. The blast door to the library is locked, but it must be forced or powered on (see “Control Room,\" above) before a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong> can bypass the lock.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library is 40 foot by 40 foot room. If the heroes expect to find hints about the holocron that <strong>Master Denia</strong> sent them to retrieve, they will be greatly disappointed. Half the library has been blown away by blaster fire, while the rest has fallen victim to looters, Sith cultists, Almasians, and, finally, Inquisitor Valin Draco. Draco learned the specific hidden location of the Qornah Holocron from Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper and took the ancient teaching apparatus down to the deepest sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the Jedi library, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This library isn’t as large as its austere counterpart on Coruscant, but the ruination that greets you is no less dismaying. Even in dim light, you can make out a room that once was filled from floor to ceiling with shelves that housed hundreds of holobooks overflowing with Jedi wisdom. Now, the repository has been pulverized into dust by blaster fire, and the shelves rest toppled at precarious angles throughout the chamber, shattered against research stations and the marble floor. The shelves are kept company by overturned chairs and damaged computers spitting sparks. About 8 feet above you is an open second floor, where even more despoiled shelves, holobooks, and datacards lie. More bloodscrawled graffiti again attests to cultist desecration. The second floor has a catwalk that cannot be reached without a hoversled. Beneath the walkway ledge, at the eastern wall, a wooden door has been splintered open. Framing it are two bronzium busts, presumably of noble Jedi, one of them decapitated. A small plaque identifies the bust as Jedi Master Qornah. The head lies on the floor, severed in half. Oddly, the inside of the sculpture appears to have sheltered something cubical.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes inspect the bust of Master Qornah, they notice a hidden compartment that is in the shape of a cube 4 inches to a side—just the right size for a Jedi holocron, as described by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. At the time of the attack on the academy, the Jedi librarian was studying the Qornah Holocron and quickly tucked it away at the first sign of danger. The Sith holocron gatekeeper told Draco exactly where to find the Qornah Holocron, and the Inquisitor cleaved the bust and claimed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The splintered east door leads into a study where older documents were held. Unlike datacards, flimsiplast burns easily (even more so in Almas’ oxygen-rich atmosphere), so the destruction here is worse. The study also served as the analysis room, and destroyed computers sit on collapsed desks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Behind the west wall is another room, hidden behind a bookshelf, with no visible entrance. The heroes can determine the existence of the secret room by comparing the map (which combines the three rooms of the library into one large room with no walls or doors) to the size and shape of the actual room. The heroes might also notice the distance between the library door and either end of the corridor outside. A successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> reveals that a hidden room exists behind the west wall, but not how to gain entrance. A successful <strong>DC 20 Wisdom (Insight)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Insight) check</strong> to sense surroundings with the force reveals the entrance. Otherwise, a successful<strong> DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to search the wall—coupled with a lot of patience—reveals the mechanism that activates the shelf.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door has to be powered on or forced (see “Control Room,\" page 12). If the door is powered on, a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (security kit) check </strong>allows the heroes to bypass the lock. Failing the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5</strong> or more triggers a silent alarm, which alerts <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> on sublevel 2. Forcing the door automatically triggers the alarm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>QUOTH OF RIVAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes find a way inside the secret archive room, they stumble upon a grisly scene. Approximately a dozen corpses of different species, all in various states of decomposition, lie scattered about the room. A descending stairway is in plain view at the other end. When the heroes jury-rig the secret door, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the blast door whooshes open, the unmistakable odor hits you like a punch from a Barabel shockboxer: decaying flesh. Strewn before you are about twenty cadavers representing the gamut of alien anatomy and osteology, from Besalisk to Dug to Pinurquian. Judging from the death grip that the deceased have on their weapons, you surmise that two different parties met here a while ago, possibly to cut a deal or as rivals of some sort, and wound up wiping each other out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You spot the descending stairway on the other side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This stairway leads to the archives level below and was reserved exclusively for Jedi Masters. (There was a backup stairway access farther north that was sealed up like a bunker, but it is now blocked to the heroes, anyway). To reach it, the heroes must traverse the obstacle course of corpses. A successful <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, giving <strong>advantage</strong> if they inspect the room before enter, lets them notice motion sensors along the walls in the center of the room, a failsafe installed by the Imperials. If the heroes do not notice the sensors, they automatically trip them, and the blast door comes crashing down. See the 'Army of Darkness' section below if this occurs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While tiptoeing through the archive room, if the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>—perhaps to see what valuables or weapons the dead bodies possess—they notice a scrap of durasheet at the center of the north wall. If they try to get a closer look, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A cold breeze from the opened blast door behind you whips into the repository, sweeping up the burnt ashes of ancient Jedi texts. One item stands out, however. At a cursory glance, it appears to be nothing more than a scrap of durasheet, except that it seems to glow eerily. You head over to inspect it and find that it contains a solitary passage, written in a language you don’t understand. You lift the unexpectedly heavy fragment, and among the only laser-pen burned words written in a recognizable tongue are two defiled parts of a name: DA-TH R-V-N.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The scrap is all that’s left of a tome that belonged to the Sith Lord Darth Rivan. If the heroes have SevenAy with them, the droid can translate the text. It was referred to by Rivan as “the creed of ruin” and is written in Sith. SevenAy translates as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This appears to be a dead language. Yes, definitely—the Sith tongue is such a peculiar one. The passage appears to . . . oh my. Quite a bleak extract. It reads:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>‘There is no passion . . . there is solely obsession.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no knowledge. There is solely conviction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no purpose. There is solely will.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is nothing . . . Only me.’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If SevenAy translates this text, a deafening rumble, like that of a giant waking from its slumber, thunders through the surviving academy structure before a violent quake throws everything into chaos. In the library outside, shelves that were still standing shatter as they crash to the floor. The archive room's blast doors slam closed, casting the room into utter darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do not trip the sensors or read the text, proceed to sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARMY OF DARKNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes are inside the archive room when the doors shut, they participate in the following encounter. If any heroes are elsewhere at the time, they will not be able to get inside until the encounter is over. The heroes have triggered a trap involving powerful parasites that animate the corpses of the dead in this room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper convinced Draco to release a two <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> parasites in the library archive room, where their<strong> telekinetic powers</strong> seemingly bring the corpses to undead life. If any of the heroes fails a <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they are affected by the surprised condition as the encounter begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter the area, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An unexpected chill runs through your spine, and you hear moans coming from somewhere behind you. Impossibly, the cadavers that were littering the floor earlier are now shambling toward your group. One of them vaguely resembles a Kel Dor. Many of the corpses hold blaster pistols in bony hands that are blemished with chunks of spoiled flesh. You have to go through them to reach the stairs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GUARDIAN SPIRIT (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Called guardian spirits due to primitive cultures’ belief that they were the spirits of the dead come back to life, these creatures are actually parasites with telekinetic abilities. The two parasites can each inhabit one corpse at a time (the Guardian Spirit statblock), giving the body a semblance of undead animation. Simultaneously, each parasite can also reanimate up to two other corpses without actually being in their bodies (the Animated Coprse statblock), but they do so less efficiently, and only to help kill the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The parasites cannot live outside of a host body for long. If the heroes kill a host body, its parasite inhabits one of the remaining animated corpses, turning it into a guardian spirit. If there are no animated corpses close enough to inhabit, the parasite has nowhere to go and is destroyed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These cadavers are actually made up of two distinct groups: the salvagers known as the Stalfonauts and bounty hunters led by the Kel Dor Jacen Yar, who had been out to capture Jedi survivors of the orbital bombardment. The two parties ran into each other in the academy library and wound up killing each other in the archive room. Now, controlled by the parasites like string puppets, their skeletal remains remember nothing of their former lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You’re surrounded by the approaching corpses. Along with their putrefied organic remains, the dark side drips from the reanimated cadavers like saliva from a predatory nexu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dancing light fills the cavernous eye sockets of their decomposing general as the Kel Dor corpse levels its blaster pistol at you.

The spirit's forcecasting ability is Charisma (power save DC 13, +5 to hit with force attacks).

If there are none within 30 feet, the parasites dissipate with a dying howl. Heroes need only wait a moment until the blast doors open to have easy access to the stairway leading down to sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library archive room contains shelves along the walls, a few desks in the middle, and a large table on the north side (where Rivan’s document is resting).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the heroes neutralize the infected corpses, they can proceed down the staircase. If some heroes were trapped outside the archive room during the encounter, the blast door becomes unlocked <strong>10 minutes</strong> after the sensors were tripped. The stairway leads to the second sublevel of the Almas Academy. Once the heroes descend the stairs, proceed to sublevel 2, below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STORAGE ROOMS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the end of the corridor, past the meditation rooms and library, the heroes can turn left. At the other (north) end of this corridor, another cave-in blocks the utility staircase leading down, which the heroes might have seen on the map or learned about from SevenAy. Unfortunately, unless they want to spend a lot of time digging through the rocks (It would take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong> of hard labor), the utility staircase is not accessible. The heroes might give up or look for another way down (see “Library,\" above).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the corridor, halfway to the utility stairway, are two blast doors. They are unlocked but need to be powered on (see “Control Room,\" above). The first room was a storage space for supplies— anything other than food that was needed by a small, self-contained community such as the Almas Academy. This room was heavily pillaged by thieves and salvagers, who left little behind but empty containers. Describe various containers of soap and torn articles of clothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they also notice two surprisingly light, tiny strongboxes with each strongbox is 8 cubic inches in size, can fit in the palm of most people's hands and are made of smooth, black iron. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> reveals that the containers are made of Mandalorian iron, which was believed to be impenetrable by the <strong>Force.</strong> If the <strong>check</strong> beats the <strong>check</strong> by an additional <strong>5</strong>, the heroes also know that the claim is false— the iron cannot stop the <strong>Force,</strong> but the strong alloy is resistant to many types of energy. The boxes have a very strong lock, equivalent to an ultrahigh security lock and opening them requires a <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second room is where the Jedi received and kept their food supplies. Most food has been stolen; the rest spoiled long ago. In the southwest corner of the room is a small kitchen where the residents prepared meals and processed foods. Describe some unidentifiable blackened mounds of rubbish, leftover kitchen appliances, a heating unit, a broken-down refrigeration unit, various utensils, and small spice containers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUBLEVEL 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This sublevel can be reached only via the staircase in the library’s secret archive room. The other staircase down is blocked (see “Storage Rooms,” above). Upon reaching this area, the heroes immediately feel a deep unease that tempts them to turn back. <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> heroes must make a <strong>DC 15 Charisma saving throw</strong> or suffer the effects of the <strong>Curse force power </strong>when using Light aligned <strong>force powers</strong>. The effect lasts as long as they are on this sublevel. Expending <strong>2 force points</strong> or a <strong>1st level force slot</strong> will negate this effect. Also, the Force Sight and<strong> Sense Force force powers</strong> do not function within range of the dark side nexus that has developed here due to Rivan’s lasting influence. Species that rely on the <strong>force</strong> to see such as Miraluka are unaffected by the dark side interference for the purposes of vision.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Encounters are labeled on the map but don’t have to be followed in the sequence presented. The encounters marked “Crazed Believers” and \"Dreambeast\" can happen in any number of rooms at your discretion. You can decide that all unused rooms are empty or permanently locked, or you can detail them as you wish (see the note block below for suggestions).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUBLEVEL 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevel 2 contains a number of rooms that are not described in this adventure. You can choose to have them empty or locked, or you can detail them as desired. Use the following as quick examples:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Surgical Bay: The walls are sterile white. The room reeks of bleach and, faintly, mildew. A half-dozen tables clutter the center. Optionally, a blast door leads to a smaller nursery room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Research Laboratory: Here, countertops and transparisteel cabinets contain various instruments and decayed samples of vegetation (such as lichens, fungi, kaluthin, and so on).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meeting Room: This room contains several chairs and a large oval table with a broken holoprojector on top. Jedi Masters held important meetings here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WEAPONS ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This room was visited recently, but the blast door controls were destroyed. Opening the door requires <strong>1 hour</strong> and a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes take the time to repair the door and open it, they find something surprising: a blaster shooting range. After all, lightsaber wielding Jedi have to practice their shooting skills, too. If the sublevel has power, several holographic targets appear when the heroes enter the room, startling them. There are representations of Gungans, Jawas, Squibs, and various small beasts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another blast door leads to a back room. If the heroes have not restored power and unlocked the doors to sublevel 2, they must open the blast door manually (see “Control Room,\" above). If they do so, they find that the back room is an armory. Transparent plexi on the ground shields a small stream that runs along just under floor level. This room has 7 usable blaster pistols and 20 power cells. Everything else has either been stolen or rusted beyond use.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REFRESHER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a fairly standard washroom for both men and women. It contains effluvial rinsers as well as refreshers. Along the floor runs a narrow natural stream, covered by transparent plexi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CRAZED BELIEVERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the west arch leading to the underground park, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the first of many crazed Humans who wander this level, looking for blood. Feel free to run this encounter more than once in any of the labeled rooms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: The heroes must defeat the Believers cultists, who have fallen under the influence of the nearby t’salak. Most cultists have killed each other already, but the few remaining groups (as many as needed, in your judgment) wander about and <strong>attack</strong> the heroes on sight. They have been exposed to the t’salak’s touch so many times that the rage it induces is effectively a form of permanent madness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: The heroes might try to subdue one or more Believers without killing them. They can accomplish this by grappling them and tying them up, stunning them with blasters, or rendering them unconscious. However, this doesn’t cure their madness, and as soon as they recover, the Believers will <strong>attack</strong> again. They must be alleviated of their delirium to be of any use. To do this, the heroes must make a DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) to have the followers calm down. If the players provide a convincing scenario through roleplaying, give them <strong>advantage.</strong> If the <strong>Restoration force power</strong> is used, the follower's delirium is also lifted while the <strong>Calm Emotions force power</strong> will also temporarily restore their sanity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Award: Alleviating the raging madness in one or more Believers provides the heroes with some information. The grateful victims negotiate their release by giving up details on the t’salak. They know where it is and what it does, but they do not know how to defeat it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter can be repeated several times throughout sublevel 2, but each time, only one group of Believers <strong>attacks</strong> the heroes. Use as many times as you feel appropriate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter a room labeled “Crazed Believers,” read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you turn the corner, you hear a cry of incoherent rage and see several beings lunge at you. They have demented looks in their eyes and are foaming at the mouth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BELIEVERS CULTISTS (3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Believers cult is a group of Sith worshippers that got its start in the Cularin system. They are males and females of different humanoid species, and they come from all walks of life. Some are even trained in the <strong>Force.</strong> They were aided in their organization by the Sith scholar Murk Lundi, and they had grown into a formidable <strong>force</strong> by the time of the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ones encountered on this sublevel have been driven mad by repeated <strong>attacks</strong> from the t’salak. They are encountered in small groups, though, since two large groups of Believers in the same room would kill each other.

They simply charge at the nearest target in their line of sight and engage in melee. Believers cultists use more straightforward tactics, trying to swarm individual heroes with <strong>melee attacks.</strong> Their leader has Battle Precognition already casted and activates Dark Shear before engaging in combat, using <strong>force powers</strong> as they go.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once a Believer is incapacitated, the heroes can search him or her for items. Some of them might carry ID cards, datapads, or other personal items tucked in the pockets of their dirty and ripped vests. They carry whatever weapons they were able to find in their mindless wanderings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of Sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Believers can be encountered in several different rooms around the sublevel. Refer to the sublevel 2 section of the adventure and the accompanying map for descriptions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>UNDERGROUND PARK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All water on Almas is underground, so the academy’s Jedi custodians reasoned that building an underground park with a running stream would be in tune with the will of the <strong>Force.</strong> The stream was discovered while digging the academy foundations. Instead of diverting it, the Jedi requested that the architects integrate the stream into the design—it was they who had intruded on the water’s natural course, after all. The Jedi then planted local trees and kaluthin and created a garden around the stream. Occasionally, they took blind coboko fish out of the pond that formed in the park center, adding them to the academy menu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of course, all the park vegetation is now dead, blackened by the intense presence of the dark side. The park also contains several bodies of Believers who managed to find the secret stairwell in the library and turned viciously on one another after encountering the t’salak. At the center of the room, beside the pool, is a large pump used to force water to the levels above. It looks like it hasn’t functioned in a long time. The heroes don’t have much time to admire the scenery, however. When they reach the park center, read the following text:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You walk into the impressive chamber, crossing a bridge than runs over a clear and soothing stream. To your left is a large pond, beyond which is an artistic elevation made of simple mud and rock. Disharmoniously, dead vegetation and dead bodies surround it all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you take in your surroundings, your companions suddenly disappear from view, and you are alone. Solid walls seem to have materialized out of nowhere and separated all of you, at the same time blocking the entrance from which you came. You feel a deep sense of dread when a cruel figure from your past appears right in front of you—someone you never imagined you would see again. You look around for a way out, but your feet don’t respond. You try to cry out, but the attempt yields no sound. As if in slow motion, the heartless figure prepares to <strong>attack.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter is similar to Luke’s experience inside the cave on Dagobah. Each hero finds him- or herself face to face with his or her worst nightmare. The heroes are caught in a combination of a mind trick (which makes them believe that they cannot walk away or speak out) and a <strong>Force illusion</strong> (which makes them believe that they are facing an old enemy).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For each hero, choose a character or creature that poses a threat and has some significance to that hero. It could be an enemy, living or dead, from a previous adventure or even from the current adventure. It could also be someone from the hero’s past (for instance, an unlikable former employer or a cruel family member). Determine the appropriate encounter for each hero in advance, without worrying about statistics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The effects of the dark side nexus permeating this place, in combination with the influence of the t’salak (which feeds on the heroes’ feelings of hate and fear), create this <strong>Force illusion</strong>. Heroes who make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> realize that their enemy is an illusion, but this knowledge does not dispel the illusion. The twist is that behind each “illusion” hides one of the other heroes. The trap is designed to cause the heroes to fight each other unknowingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Prior to the adventure, ask the players for their character sheets, and record their most important scores (<strong>weapon damage dice</strong>, <strong>attack bonuses</strong> and types, defenses, hit points, <strong>Initiative</strong> and skills, and so on). Then, when each hero faces an illusion, describe what weapons or items the opponent carries—in other words, the weapons or items used by the other hero. There is no need for an illusion to wield the same exact weapon as the hero behind it, but the weapon should resemble something in the same class (such as a vibrosword, blaster, lightsaber, and so on).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the number of heroes is uneven, one of the heroes is met by a crazed Believer instead of by another hero (for statistics, see “Crazed Believers,”). In this case, the Believer hides behind the illusion of a friend, such as <strong>Senator Organa, Master Denia</strong>, or even one of the other heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Explain to the heroes that they are all inexplicably isolated from one another. Ask for <strong>initiative</strong> rolls, and record the results beside each hero’s name. As soon as an <strong>attack</strong> occurs, use player who is opposite them as a target. If the <strong>attack</strong> hits and <strong>damage</strong> is dealt, record the number. Pretend that the next <strong>initiative</strong> turn belongs to the opponent of the hero just <strong>attacked,</strong> describe the <strong>attack,</strong> and reveal the <strong>damage</strong> dealt. If one hero is fighting a Believer, this fight can be incorporated with the others in order of <strong>initiative</strong> but treated as regular combat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Allow each character a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> at the beginning of their turn to realize that something is not right. Success indicates that the hero can tell that what he sees before him is not real, though it looks as if it could become real at any moment. If a matched pair of heroes goes for <strong>3 consecutive rounds</strong> without <strong>attacking</strong> each other, the entire illusion is dispelled for the whole group, and the angry t’salak <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER EXAMPLE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how this encounter could be run. Assume that the party contains five heroes, so four of the heroes fight each other, while the fifth fights a Believer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vor’en the soldier (Init 20) versus Arani the noble (Init 14)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kelko the scout (Init 16) versus Sia-Lan the Jedi (Init 28)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Deel the scoundrel (Init 24) versus a Believer (Init 8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 1</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sia-Lan is up first, and she‘s face to face with Count Dooku. But Sia-Lan makes her <strong>Perception check</strong> and knows that Dooku is dead, so she realizes that the encounter must be a trick. She decides<strong> not to attack.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Deel finds himself facing one of his friends, Kelko, who runs madly toward him. Deel asks him what is going on, but his voice is mysteriously soundless. He fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and doesn’t realize that it's a trick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Vor’en fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and thinks that he’s run into a <strong>stormtrooper.</strong> He pulls out a blaster and fires at the enemy, striking Arani and dealing 8 points of energy <strong>damage.</strong> (From Arani’s perspective, she’s shot by an old friend, who wields a hold-out blaster that she gave him long ago.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Kelko (who also failed his <strong>Perception check</strong>) takes out his two vibrodaggers to <strong>attack</strong> a green, tentacled alien that he once encountered on Zlarbv IV. He slashes at it, dealing <strong>12 points</strong> of <strong>kinetic damage</strong> to Sia-Lan. (From Sia-Lan’s perspective, Count Dooku <strong>attacks</strong> her with two lightsabers. The Jedi doesn’t understand what’s happening—she was sure that the appearance of Dooku was some kind of trick!)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Arani succeeds on her <strong>Perception check</strong> and tries to convince the phantom that she is no threat, but he doesn’t seem to hear her. She has to defend herself, so she pulls out her own blaster and shoots him, dealing <strong>12 points of energy damage.</strong> (From Vor’en’s perspective, he’s shot by the <strong>stormtrooper.)</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, the Believer acts, rushing Deel and pummeling him to the ground, dealing <strong>15 points of kinetic damage.</strong> (From Deel’s perspective, he’s being <strong>attacked</strong> by his friend Kelko. Has he gone crazy? Regardless, Deel decides that he must defend himself.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sia-Lan can’t believe it. Count Dooku just <strong>attacked</strong> and nearly killed her. Maybe “Dooku” is a clone, a doppelganger, or something else, but whatever it is, Sia-Lan was hurt for real and must defend herself. She ignites her lightsaber, preparing to <strong>attack</strong> Kelko . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OOZING MADNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can enter the underground park via one of two arches. The t’salak is hiding behind the pond on an elevated slope at the room’s northern side. The heroes must cross the pond to get to the creature, or shoot it from a distance (which is a much wiser option).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Evil. That's the first word that comes to mind as you look at the featureless pool of black ooze. Suddenly, a tendril snaps at you, <strong>attacking</strong> from the creature’s central mass, almost too fast to see. You barely avoid it, but as you dodge, the creature tracks you move for move. It seems filled with hate and bent on pure destruction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A <strong>Force-sensitive </strong>creature of unknown origin, the t’salak is an oozing, black mound of evil. A specimen was first encountered in the jungles of Cularin and subsequently imprisoned inside a <strong>Force-imbued </strong>urn. The urn was buried inside a cave and guarded by a Tarasin village for generations, until recently stolen by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun. With the help of scientists, Raik discovered a way to divide the t’salak into independent entities of equal power. It is unknown how many more specimens remain in existence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak has no sensory organs but leaves no question as to its strength and cunning; it lashes out with sticky tendrils that have surprising accuracy and power. Filled with chaotic thoughts born of malignity, the t’salak can induce a blinding rage in its targets just by touching them, permeating their souls with darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak moves toward the heroes and tries to hit them with its tendrils to induce rage in them. The creature hopes that the heroes will be too distracted by killing each other to <strong>attack</strong> it, so that it can go back to its hiding place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak cannot be killed by solid objects, but it can be wounded and is highly susceptible to cold and vacuum. Unless the t’salak is trapped within a container imbued by the <strong>Force</strong> or made of Beskar or finally in a cold vacuum while it is inert (0 hit points), it regenerates itself and <strong>attacks</strong> anew.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium aberration, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (natural armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 170 (20d8+80)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft., climb 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 16 (+3) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +8, Con +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities Cold</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy and kinetic damage from weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Exhaustion, Frightened, Poison, Prone</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses Blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (3,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Induce Raging Madness. When the t'salak deals damage to a creature from a <strong>melee attack,</strong> the creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must make at least one <strong>attack</strong> against the closest ally on its turn. The creature repeats this save on the end of its turn with a successful save removing this effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regeneration. The t'salak regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. When reduced to 0 hitpoints, the t'salak becomes an inert puddle for <strong>5 minutes</strong> and then after <strong>10 minutes</strong> it returns to maximum health unless it is contained inside a container made of beskar, a container that is is <strong>force imbued</strong> or exposed to a vacuum.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tendril.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The t'salak regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tendril. The t'salak makes one attack with its tendrils.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The lake in the middle of the room is an obstacle to the heroes as it counts as difficult terrain. Once across, they can climb the slope on the other side. To reach the area where the t’salak is hiding from across either stream area, the heroes must climb up the 7 foot high muddy hillock that forms the north shore of the pool. It is slippery, requiring a successful <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>. There are some slim trees scattered about the gardens, but they provide very little cover or concealment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THERE'S SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT THIS PLACE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter one of the rooms labeled “Dreambeast” (your choice), an extreme cold envelops them. The heroes immediately fall into a profound sleep without realizing it. Read the following text:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you enter the room, your vision fogs momentarily. You shake your head vigorously and feel slightly dizzy. You blink your eyes in rapid succession, then scour your surroundings suspiciously, looking for anything amiss. But everything seems normal. Your friends are all here, and you feel fine now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Still, there is something familiar about this place . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The room is an illusion, a trap devised by the Sith holocron gatekeeper and created by Inquisitor Draco. As the heroes proceed through the sublevel toward the nexus of evil, they are unwittingly immersing themselves more and more fully within Rivan’s aura of influence. This is doubly true now that the holocron gatekeeper of the Dark Lord has found a cohort in the Inquisitor, augmenting <strong>Draco’s powers</strong> significantly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wherever this encounter plays out, the sleeping heroes discover that the room looks identical to one they’ve previously visited. If they attempt to exit the room, they stumble into another familiar area of the academy, but not one normally connected to the room they are leaving, creating a disorienting effect. You should try to create the claustrophobia of a recurring nightmare from which the heroes cannot seem to wake. To drive the point home, you can repeat descriptions of academy chambers that the heroes have visited already. Each time, preface the description with one of the following three phrases (preferably in this order):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There’s something’s not right here . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There’s something familiar about this place . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You’ve got a very bad feeling about this . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The longer their minds remain under <strong>Draco’s power</strong>, the more despair eats away at their confidence and motivation. For every encounter that the heroes relive in the dreamscape, their “dream persona” gains one level of exhaustion. However, the heroes can have a maximum of three encounters in the dreamscape. During each encounter, the heroes have a chance to break free of the illusion. With their minds playing tricks on them, they need to overcome their own senses; each hero can make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</strong> once per faux-encounter. If they succeed, they wake up, preventing Draco from further sapping their moral strength. Otherwise, after the third encounter, the heroes awaken regardless, though their exhaustion is persistent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any hero avoids Draco’s trap entirely—that is, if a hero does not enter the room at all—she does not enter the dreamscape. Instead, she realizes that she nearly fell to a dark side trick and can see her friends lying unconscious in the room. Heroes caught in the dreamscape take note of the “missing” party members, and their interaction with them is limited.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any hero who avoided Draco’s trap sees her sleeping friends writhe and groan in mental anguish. She can’t shake them awake, but once per dreamscape encounter, she can try to communicate with them. However, her words will be distorted. The dreamer should be baffled by the gibberish, but a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong> deciphers the words. If that occurs, the hero can make the <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> to realize that he is trapped in a dream state and escape immediately. If the hero fails the <strong>saving throw</strong>, he goes on to have another déjà vu experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless of the manner by which the heroes awaken, immediately thereafter, they must battle a fearsome k’kayeh dreambeast that has anchored itself to the heroes and pursued them into the waking world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes defeat the k’kayeh dreambeast and its spawn, it disappears as if it never existed. A true k’kayeh will make a stunning appearance at the end of the adventure, but for now, heroes can continue exploring the area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE DREAMS BEASTS ARE MADE OF</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though the heroes have snapped out of their dream daze, they are still under Draco’s influence and come face to face with an enormous dark side apparition. This semi-incorporeal creature has chased them into the physical world, and the heroes find themselves under assault almost immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As soon as the heroes revive from their collective nightmare, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>No sooner have you gathered your wits from your feverish collective dream than a huge monster spawned from nightmare slithers in through the entryway. Double the size of even the biggest bull rancor, the reptilian colossus drags its golden body into the chamber, scales shifting along its hide like impenetrable plates of anvilstone. As it lets rip an ear-splitting roar, double rows of goring fangs leave little to the imagination.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>K'KAYEH DREAMBEAST (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The k’kayeh dragon is the greatest product of Darth Rivan’s dark arts. A <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> abomination, this Sithspawn’s sandy scales match the color of Almas’ desert wasteland and are as tough as armor plating. The serpentine creature is also amphibious, as comfortable in open air as swimming in the planet’s hidden underground lakes. The k’kayeh’s maw is a steely-toothed deathtrap, and its claws are eviscerating razors. As if that weren’t enough, instead of breathing fire, this dark side abomination can shoot<strong> Force lightning </strong>from each nostril of its monstrous snout.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This “dreambeast” is only a tenth the size of the truly gigantic k’kayeh that lurks in the depths of the Almas Academy, but it is still enormous. Similar to Sith dopplegangers, this k’kayeh dreambeast is an illusory clone of the actual living entity, spawned by Inquisitor Draco under the guidance of Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper.

It then makes three attacks: one with its claws, and two with its bite. It can use its devour instead of its bite.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 15 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage. If the target is large or smaller, the target is now grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the K'kayeh Dreambeast can't bite another target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The K’kayeh Dreambeast exhales force lightning in a 90 foot cone. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Devour. The K’kayeh Dreambeast makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the K’kayeh Dreambeast, and it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the K’kayeh Dreambeast's turns. If the K’kayeh Dreambeast takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the K’kayeh Dreambeast must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the K’kayeh Dreambeast. If the K’kayeh Dreambeast dies, a swallowed creature appears within a space that the K'kayeh Dreambeast occupied as K'kayeh Dreambeast's body vanishes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Frightful Roar. Each creature of the K’kayeh Dreambeast's choice within 90 feet of it must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for <strong>1 minute</strong>. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the K’kayeh Dreambeast is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the K’kayeh Dreambeast's Frightful Roar for the next <strong>24 hours</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most disturbing thing about the beast is its snout. Sure, you’ve read the fairy tales about fire-breathing monsters. You may even have fought a dragon-slug on Corulag. But as you watch dark side lightning dance wickedly from one of the creature’s mammoth nostrils to the other, you know only one thing for certain . . . you’re in trouble.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>K'KAYEH DREAMBEAST TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The k’kayeh dreambeast has many weapons at its disposal. Besides its teeth and claws, it uses its<strong> force lightning</strong> breath when avaliable to hit as many heroes as possible. Any cover in the room can be crushed (or appear to be crushed) by the enormous beast. Any hero grabbed by the creature winds up in its mouth to be consumed, taking <strong>damage</strong> from its arm-length teeth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIVING NIGHTMARE (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Living nightmares are manifestations of <strong>Force energy</strong> that appear in shifting, horrific forms. They usually take on the forms of monstrous beings from their targets’ memories and <strong>attack</strong> the minds of their opponents. The k’kayeh dreambeast creates these nightmares from the dark energy suffusing the remains of the Almas Academy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This creature is horrific in its visage, yet looks as though it is only partially in our world. Its form continually shifts from one monstrous appearance to another, and it drifts through the air as though it has no mass of its own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIVING NIGHTMARE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium aberration, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 41 (9d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6 (-2) 17 (+3) 10 (+0) 5 (-2) 15 (+2) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy and kinetic damage from unenhanced weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Attack the Mind. The Living Nightmare strikes a single creature within 5 ft of it with psychic energy forcing the target to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw.

On a successful save the target takes half damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIVING NIGHTMARE TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given their semi-corporeal nature, living nightmares tend to focus their <strong>attacks</strong> on opponents that cannot harm them. However, if they discover that a player has a particularly low <strong>Intelligence save,</strong> they will target that opponent instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When defeated, the k’kayeh dragon and the living nightmares fade away. The room returns to its original state, and any feature of the area that appeared destroyed is returned to normal. Any hero who has been “eaten” is found on the floor where the creature disappeared.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The k’kayeh dreambeast and the living nightmares can be encountered in several different rooms around the sublevel.

If they pass the room without entering it, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the nighthunter that guards Thorla. The blast door is open, and the Twi’lek Jedi Master’s <strong>powers</strong> are kept in <strong>check</strong> inside a Universal Energy Cage designed to contain<strong> Force-users</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DRACO'S BEST FRIEND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are <strong>attacked</strong> in the corridors outside the prison room. The nighthunter lunges directly at them and runs away when hurt, only to <strong>attack</strong> again from another direction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes near the room where Master Thorla is held prisoner, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is a burnt-red blur, like the flash of a lightsaber, and the face of the friend nearest you nearly winds up sliced off and on the floor. But your <strong>attacker</strong> is no Sith. Crouched in front of you are 7 hulking feet of quadrupedal, ravenous instinct. The crimson predator is a nighthunter, believed to be as extinct as the Jedi. You consider that the creature might be a good omen in a way—that is, until it bellows a spine-tingling howl.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIGHTHUNTER (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s the blood-red, blaster-resistant hide. Maybe it’s the claws, which are nearly as long as the fangs protruding up to its eyes and down to its chin. Or maybe it’s the fact that these creatures ambush their prey using the <strong>Force.</strong> Whatever it is, nighthunters give even Jedi pause. Xenobiologists believe that nighthunters are a mutant offshoot of another species, with Myrkr’s vornskrs ranking high on the list due to their whiplike tails, <strong>Force-sensitivity,</strong> and variety of subspecies. Some contend that nighthunters inspired the hellhounds of Corellian myth. No one really knows.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>Force-using</strong> predators have been hunted almost to extinction, but the one guarding Master Thorla shares a peculiar history with Inquisitor Draco. The creature hunted an injured Draco in the aftermath of the Battle of Parein II 4, and they nearly killed each other. However, after wounding the nighthunter, Draco nurtured it back to health, and the beast bonded to its savior. Draco kept the animal and gave it the name Crant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The creature’s hide looks blaster resistant. Its huge anterior claws rake at the floor in tandem with those of its hind paws, grinding out a symphony that hurts your ears and chills your blood. Five immense fangs jut out and over both of its lips, almost concealing its face, except for its two tiny, hungry eyes. As you watch its whiplike tail dancing like a vine snake about to strike, you realize that in this confined space, the beast has a good chance of ripping you into bite-sized chunks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIGHTHUNTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium beast, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 72 (13d8+13)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14 (+2) 18 (+4) 12 (+1) 3 (-4) 12 (+1) 6 (-2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Perception +4, Stealth +10, Survival +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy, fire</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 5 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Sensitive. The Nighthunter's forcecasting ability is Wisdom (power save DC 11, +3 to hit with force attacks).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Nighthunter knows the following powers:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At-will: force camouflage</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Keen Hearing and Smell.

The Nighthunter can make two claw attacks and a bite attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) kinetic damage.

The beast circles around, uses <strong>force camouflage </strong>and stealthily comes back from another direction, perhaps <strong>several rounds later</strong>. You can create tension by having the heroes make <strong>Perception checks</strong> if they are not searching for the nighthunter. They might think it’s gone and proceed with their exploration, only to be <strong>attacked</strong> in a different area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After defeating the beast, the heroes can enter the room it guarded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use the corridors around the <strong>prison room.</strong> If the heroes find refuge inside a room and lock it, they prevent the creature from <strong>attacking.</strong> But they must come out eventually, and the nighthunter is very patient. The room in which Master Thorla is detained doesn’t have a working blast door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Having dealt with the Nighthunter, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door is completely open. In fact, burn damage all along the 12 foot-wide entrance appears to have enlarged it. A pulsating glow within lights up the darkened room. Inside, you find a spherical energy cage floating on repulsorlifts. The glow comes from a force field that surrounds the portable <strong>prison,</strong> and behind the bars lies a crumpled humanoid form.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The man, a Twi’lek, meets your gaze with a look of utter despair. Instead of exhibiting hope at the sight of potential rescuers, he quickly looks away, as if to say, “Leave me alone.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This room also contains a thick plasteel table, with traces of a black substance on it and a Jedi robe sprawled across it. Master Thorla is in very bad shape, both physically and mentally. His body is emaciated, and he sports several burns and cuts. To run this dramatic encounter, you must understand the Jedi’s backstory (see the sidebar on page 18). The heroes might suspect that the prisoner is a Jedi and decide to free him. If they interrogate him, Thorla tells them to leave him alone and that he is beyond redemption.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Universal Energy Cage was designed specifically to contain a <strong>Force-user’s powers</strong>. Prisoners in the cage can, however, use the <strong>Force</strong> at very low levels, such as casting cantrips. The cage’s functions are controlled by a handheld remote that is currently in Draco’s possession. The cage has no visible controls, and the only way to open it is to destroy it, which endangers the life of the prisoner within. The Universal Energy Cage has a <strong>damage threshold</strong> of <strong>10</strong> and 55 (5d10) hit points. The cage is also built with a contact shock field, and every time the cage receives <strong>damage</strong> from an <strong>attack</strong> that deals <strong>25 damage</strong> or more, the Jedi inside receives a nonlethal shock that deals <strong>9 ([[/r 2d8[lightning] # Lightning damage]])  damage</strong>, this effect also occurs when an <strong>attack</strong> would automatically miss. When this happens, Thorla yelps in pain, but does not otherwise react.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the Jedi is free, whether he is conscious or not, the heroes notice that his skin is charred in multiple places, showing that he has suffered many shocks. He has four levels of exhaustion, which can only be removed by receiving extensive, long-term medical and psychological care. If Thorla is conscious, he does not run away or try to escape, but he won’t answer the heroes’ questions, either, wanting only to be left alone. He’s been fighting off Draco’s attempts at turning him to the dark side and has fallen into despair. Since the loss of his Padawan, Thorla has become disconsolate, and any mention of Jedi or Imperials angers him. He has an unfriendly attitude and if the heroes physically push or restrain him, he becomes violent and <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter is a chance for heroes with investment in <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> to be very useful. With some good roleplaying and a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, Thorla might be coaxed into revealing that he was a Jedi, but that he no longer has the will to go on. If the player beats a <strong>DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> instead, Thorla will become friendly and additionally answer questions about his captors. An alternative way to convince Thorla to talk is to show Thorla his Padawan’s broken lightsaber (if the heroes obtained it from the Squibs).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thorla can provide the following information:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He knows Inquisitor Draco and Raik Muun, and he suspects that they are inside the archives room in the southwest corner of the sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If asked about a holocron, he reveals that indeed the Inquisitor has one in his possession.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thorla refuses to accompany the heroes willingly. He says that all the Jedi are dead and there is no reason to go on—not with sadistic torturers like Draco running the galaxy. If told of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, the Twi’lek says he’s never heard of her, and besides, one more Jedi won’t make any difference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In any case, when the heroes realize that the broken Jedi will not budge, they should move on. As long as the heroes leave Thorla alive, he might appear again later in the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VHIIN’THORLA, SURVIVOR OF ORDER 66</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A green-skinned Twi'lek, Vhiin'Thorla studied at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he befriended fellow student Devan For'deschel. Thorla eventually became a Jedi Master and a skilled duelist, participating in many missions. One of these missions changed his life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>About a <strong>year before</strong> the Clone Wars sparked, he and his Padawan Kritz Drassarb were sent to investigate a band of pirates in the Mid Rim. After <strong>two months</strong>, the ruthless organization was dismantled, but at the cost of Kritz’s life. Thorla blamed himself for his student’s death and exiled himself to his homeworld of Ryloth. He sought solitude in the planet's badlands but soon found a new purpose.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A<strong> few months</strong> into the Clone Wars, Master Devan sent envoys to Ryloth to invite her old friend to join her at the Almas Academy as the new Master of Lightsabers. When the envoys finally found Thorla, they discovered that he had spent the <strong>last year</strong> rescuing Twi'lek prisoners from slavers and had formed a community called the Enclave. Thorla had also taken on a new Padawan, a young Lethan Twi’lek named Dorv'Tilsta. Witnessing all the good that Master Thorla was accomplishing, the envoys respected his decision to decline Master Devan’s offer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Increasing slaver <strong>attacks</strong> forced Thorla to delay a visit to the Almas Academy. Then Order 66 came. Thorla felt the death of his fellow Jedi through the <strong>Force</strong> and moved the Enclave to a more secure location, but after <strong>two long years,</strong> he risked exposure to learn more about the current state of the galaxy. Repulsed by what he discovered, he decided to investigate the fate of his old friend Devan on Almas, taking his <strong>10-year-old</strong> Padawan with him. What he found was a demolished academy at the heart of a ghost town. He probed the ruins, winding his way down to the deepest sublevel, where he knew the secured archives were located.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fate was not on Thorla’s side. Inquisitor Draco and his retinue arrived shortly thereafter, and a fierce lightsaber duel ensued. However, Draco’s Dark Jedi lapdog Raik Muun held Thorla's inexperienced Padawan hostage and induced a murderous rage into young Dorv with her evil t'salak, forcing him to <strong>attack</strong> his own master. A tortured Thorla fended off his Padawan, while Draco threatened to turn the boy to the dark side if Thorla refused to fight. Remorsefully, Thorla finally severed Dorv from life and misery. At that moment, the Twi'lek master snapped and fell to the dark side, racked with guilt over losing another Padawan. He desired to die, but the Imperials denied him this wish. He’s been held in a Universal Energy Cage ever since, meditating on how he lost his way as a Jedi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: DRACO'S LAIR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes descend into the depths of the Jedi academy, they draw closer to the nexus of dark power surrounding Inquisitor Draco. You should emphasize the growing sense of dread the heroes feel, including a strong sense of danger for any <strong>force sensitive</strong> players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARCHIVES ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes reach the archives room (whether they found it themselves or were informed by SevenAy or Master Thorla), they find the door tightly shut. They can open the door by following the procedures described in “Control Room” from the first sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes enter the archives room, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You find yourselves in a long room, 45 feet wide by 80 feet long, with the chamber forking to the right about 30 feet in. Leaning against the smooth walls are cases containing fascinating and rare artifacts and weapons that were of interest to the Jedi. It is surprising that most of them seem untouched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most glaring features of the room are the far wall and floor, which have crumbled away to reveal a cavernous opening that leads into a dark tunnel. This obviously wasn’t part of the room’s original design and seems to be a consequence of the orbital bombardment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This chamber was forbidden to Padawans. It was where the Jedi Masters kept their most precious <strong>Force</strong> artifacts, including the holocron the heroes seek (until it was hidden in the bust of Master Qornah). It also contains the entrance to the underground caves where Draco is consulting with the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan. To keep intruders from interrupting his studies, Draco left behind some of the deadliest henchbeings in the galaxy to guard the cave entrance. Several creatures await the heroes here, as motionless as statues in their hiding places among the shadows. Masters of stealth, these steely, grayskinned warriors are all but undetectable in the dim light.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If players decide to investigate the room they will discover that information that relates to Inquisitor Draco and Darth Rivan's Holocron, specifically that Sith holocrons can sometimes bond to a <strong>force user</strong> granting them additional power. It is possible to disrupt this connection by the use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes enter the archives room, have them roll <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> against the creatures’ <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) checks</strong>, with <strong>disadvantage</strong> unless they have some form of light. If the heroes succeed, one of their light sources or pure chance illuminates what appears to be a five foot-high statue resembling a gargoyle in one of the corners. This is enough warning for the heroes to avoid being ambushed, and a <strong>second later</strong>, six repulsive “statues” pounce on them from all sides. If the heroes fail their roll, the players are affected by the surprise condition as combat starts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players are not startled and make a successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Lore)</strong> or <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Nature) check</strong>, they can identify the species of their attackers. These squat killing machines are called Noghri, aliens seldom seen away from their home planet.

The Noghri are perched on marble columns in the far corner of the room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in this area, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s darker here than in any of the other areas you’ve visited so far. A chill breeze hits you from directly in front. How can there be a draft in an underground level? On the map, this room shows as an “L” shape, but you can’t see anything at all around the bend. As you advance, you have the sneaking suspicion that you’re being watched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NOGHRI WARRIORS (5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gray-skinned and compact Noghri are among the most recent and deadly additions to the Imperial ranks. Though an acute xenophobia has begun to manifest within the Galactic Empire, Darth Vader readily recognized the value of the species during a visit to their homeworld Honoghr. When the five foot-tall warriors proved a match for his 501st Legion <strong>stormtrooper</strong> escort, the Dark Lord immediately found a way to enslave the species. Destiny arguably brought the two together, for the Noghri’s frightful faces so resemble the masked visage of their new master, the likeness seems uncanny.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dubbed “Death Commandos,” the Noghri are perfectly evolved killing machines—quick, quiet and deceptively strong. In unarmed combat, they excel at stava, their martial art named after a ferocious native predator, and they wield Stokhli spray sticks or simple knives with deadly efficiency. Vader bestowed Draco with this squad of Noghri assassins in gratitude for the Inquisitor’s assistance in torturing the captured Jedi Knight Halagad Ventor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a flash, you are assaulted by aliens that look like gargoyles.

If they stun or incapacitate the heroes, they bring the prisoners before Draco. Otherwise, the Noghri fight fiercely to prevent intruders from interrupting Draco, but they will be reasonable if they see that they are outmatched. They prefer to fight in melee, using their stealth and martial arts to devastating effect. If the heroes try to escape by entering the tunnel, the Noghri give chase.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each Noghri has 1000 credits each for a total of 6000 credits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the Death Commandos, they are free to enter the tunnel leading down to Draco’s location.

The room also contains some ancient Jedi items, none of which offer much help to the heroes aside from a few wooden shields and lances. The items are held inside transparisteel display cases along the south and north walls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NEARING THE NEXUS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes investigate the opening in the far wall, they see that the crumbled floor and wall have revealed a tunnel. It slopes downward into utter darkness, and the rocky ground is made slippery by the natural spring that runs across the second sublevel of the academy. The slope is 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, prompting two <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks </strong>to get down, a player with a climb speed only makes one <strong>check.</strong> A hero who fails a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>9 or less</strong> suffers a minor slip but does not fall. A hero who fails a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>10 or more</strong> also causes a rockslide, dealing <strong>[[/r 2d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to himself and anyone below him. If the heroes have no light source, they must move even more cautiously and make an additional <strong>Strength (Athletics) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>The players if they have rope, may use that to lower themselves down instead, avoiding the <strong>checks</strong> entirely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTER THE DRAGON</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at the bottom, Valin Draco is waiting for them, literally surrounded by darkness. He has the controls to Thorla’s Universal Energy Cage in his possession and is studying the Qornah Holocron with the Rivan holocron gatekeeper. As the heroes approach, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You make out a figure in a flowing scarlet robe of septsilk. You recognize him from the message you received many <strong>months</strong> ago after your adventure on <strong>Bespin</strong>: Inquisitor Valin Draco. He is flanked on one side by a stern-looking female whose lightsaber gives a red tint to their surroundings. There is a glint in Draco’s eye and a chilling smile on his lips, as if he already knows more about you than you know about yourselves. Just behind Draco, an incandescent object floats in the air, seeming to grow out of a small cube strapped to Draco’s forearm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hiding behind rocks on both sides of the Inquisitor are two blackarmored Imperial <strong>shadow troopers.</strong> A player who manages to pass a <strong>DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> can barely make them out in the darkness. Draco has the Dark Jedi Raik Muun flanking him, red lightsaber ignited, and directly behind him hovers an indistinct blot resonating with evil. This is the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan, which provides Draco with advanced knowledge of Sith techniques throughout the fight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco is a methodical villain. His preferred method of dealing with his enemies is to convert them to his cause, a tactic that has worked equally well on Raik and the nighthunter, and that nearly succeeded on Jedi Master Vhiin’Thorla. Draco knows that to have reached this far, the heroes must have defeated challenges that would have sundered less formidable foes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, before Draco invites the heroes to join him, he greets them with a single word: “Crant?” This is the name of Draco’s nighthunter. It’s unlikely that the heroes will know this, so Draco elaborates:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Crant—my companion. Have you come to tell me that my nighthunter is dead?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can tell Draco whatever they wish. If they confirm that they have killed the beast, Draco betrays no emotion, though the glint in his eye dulls. However, he immediately gathers his composure and begins his entreaty as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I am Valin Draco, and, like you, I once thought myself a hero. During the Clone Wars, the brave men and women I commanded called me the ‘Valiant Dragon’ as we fought in epic conflicts for the corrupt Republic. But after I was left for dead on the battlefield of Parein II 4, flattering titles lost their meaning for me. “These are dark times, and I know that you’ve suffered great losses, that you wrestle with the same concerns of virtue and compromise that I did as a Jedi, the same concerns that have plagued the conscientious since time immemorial. Surrender yourselves to the Empire. I promise your treatment will be gentler, and you might even be given the chance to serve me. Surrender yourselves—or face your destiny.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco’s offer is sincere. Here are some possible answers to common questions that the heroes might have for the Inquisitor:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why do you serve the Empire? “Beware rash judgments. The difference between an enemy and a friend is not as obvious as we’d like to think. My allegiance to the Galactic Empire is born of necessity, and you will reap the benefits if you recognize that your destiny lies with me.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is your view of the dark side of the Force? “The dark side exists. Only the naïve and demented believe otherwise. It’s found in each of us without exception—Sith, Jedi, soldier, smuggler, noble, rogue, and romantic. I will show you how to control it so that you needn’t fear or deny it.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why don’t you join us? “I have already found my true self. I embraced my destiny when I took this Inquisitor’s garb. Now, quit this cowardly stalling, and reflect on my invitation, for this is the last time I extend it. Decide swiftly and without regret, for your choice and its effects were predetermined before these words ever obligated you to speak.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s highly unlikely that any of the heroes will take Draco up on his offer. However, this could be an opportunity for some dramatic storytelling. Perhaps one of the players has grown bored with her character. If so, collaborate with her in secret ahead of time so that her character joins Draco’s retinue for a devastating twist, similar to Vader’s revelation of Luke’s parentage in The Empire Strikes Back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In all likelihood, the heroes reject Draco’s supplication or simply <strong>attack</strong> him. Once they do, the disquieting glint in his eye returns, as if he’s foreseen their response. Draco ignites his lightsaber, Raik Muun takes up a protective position in front of him, and the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> prepare to snipe from their hiding spots. As soon as the heroes <strong>attack,</strong> Draco allows the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan to instruct him, teaching him some of the Dark Lord’s powers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes managed to free Master Thorla earlier in the adventure, he arrives at the beginning of the encounter to assist the heroes in their fight. If no heroes discover the means of separating Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper from its connection to the holocron, Thorla uses the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> to grant the heroes a reprieve from the Sith holocron’s influence over Draco on his turns. Thorla has Inspiration, which he saves until the heroes reduce Draco to half his hit points or fewer. When that occurs, on his next turn, Master Thorla gains a use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>, then uses it against Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper, spending the Inspiriation to peel the gatekeeper from the holocron. The gatekeeper howls in rage as it is stripped from the holocron. As the faux Rivan dissipates, the holocron begins to overload, and Draco rips it from his arm and hurls it at Thorla. The holocron shatters, unbalancing Thorla and knocking him into the chasm below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes did not free Master Thorla, he does not come to the rescue. However, he might contact <strong>Force-using</strong> heroes telepathically instead. A Force-using hero in telepathic contact with Thorla can use the Jedi Master’s <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> as though they were the players. Additionally, if the <strong>Force-using</strong> hero does not think to use Inspiration with <strong>Force Suppression,</strong> the Jedi Master tells the hero to do so when Draco is below half of his hit points.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Master Thorla is dead, the heroes receive none of the above benefits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4x CR 1 Shadow Troopers (Headhunter Block) 1x CR 4 Raik Munn (Inquisitor Knight Block) 1x CR 7 Draco (Inquisitor Master)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes start on the east side of the map, at the exit from the tunnel that leads back to the sublevel 2. The opponents are near the opposite side, as indicated on the map, at the end of a ledge that is 40 feet by 10 feet. Raik Muun is in front of Draco, and the four <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are hiding behind rocks, aiming at the heroes. There is another, narrower ledge on the south side of the map, but if the heroes take that route, the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> shoot at them. In the center of the room are two cavernous pits, at the bottom of which lies a body of water.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If his invitation to join him is rebuffed, Inquisitor Draco undergoes a sinister transformation and <strong>attacks</strong> with his minions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“As you die, rest assured that I reflected on you as on all enemies: despising that you must be wrong and I right, but reveling in the triumph of my convictions while whatever species of maggot indigenous to this world expedites the transition of your carcasses from this existence to the next.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While Draco speaks, the sinister blot hovering behind him seems to pulse and seethe with rage. Before your eyes, the wraith seems to transfer some of its dark energy into the Inquisitor, wreathing the Human in shadows. The evil holocron gatekeeper hovering in the room seems to writhe with malevolence, and there is clearly some vile connection between it and the Inquisitor. Draco’s eyes acquire a sickening gold hue, and his voice plummets in pitch as he gives a command to the woman and soldiers at his side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“My brave companions—kill them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nearly 6'5 tall, with closely cropped hair and a lantern jaw, Valin Draco looks every bit the heroic Jedi he once was. The former Padawan of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, Jedi Draco, the “Valiant Dragon,” embraced his role as a Republic commander in the Clone Wars wholeheartedly. However, at some point during the conflict, his heady determination to defeat the Separatist threat evolved into something pernicious, and he turned to the dark side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco was thought lost in the chaotic Battle of Parein II 4, but he emerged after the Clone Wars as one of the new Empire’s Jedi hunters. Left for dead and stranded on Parein II’s fourth moon, a weakened Draco was stalked by a nighthunter. Ultimately, Draco subdued the beast in a vicious confrontation, but not before the creature bit off his left thumb and clamped its massive fangs down around his throat. Draco has since replaced the missing thumb with a cybernetic substitute, while masking the glaring scars around his neck with the high collar of his Inquisitor’s tunic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco arrived in the Cularin system in the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> accompanied by a Lictor-class Imperial dungeon ship, Revelator. However, unable to traverse the comet field in the vessel, Draco and his entourage made the journey to Almas in a Theta class shuttle, tucked safely away at what’s left of the Forard spaceport.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Valin Draco activates his <strong>Rage power </strong>and engages the players in melee combat, using <strong>Saber Reflect </strong>or <strong>Parry</strong> when appropriate. He will happily use his <strong>force powers</strong> if he thinks them useful but will always save at least <strong>3 force points</strong> so he can cast Phasewalk to escape to the next chamber when he drops to to half hp or if his allies are killed. During this encounter he does not use any of his legendary actions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (battle precognition)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 83 (11d8+44)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 13 (+1) 16 (+3) 20 (+5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +8, Wis +6, Cha +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +8, Intimidation +8, Perception +6, Stealth +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Bocce, Dosh, Honoghran, Huttese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (2,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting.

A Zelosian, he defied nearly every stereotype of his gregarious people except for his knowledge of plant biology, and his Sith moniker is believed to have been culled from a corrupted Sith text, possibly written by Darth Revan. As the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith sometime between <strong>1,150</strong> and <strong>1,400 years ago,</strong> Rivan’s story is intimately tied to an object he called the Darkstaff. Drawn to this dark side artifact, Rivan erected a stronghold on the poisonous planet Almas, using the <strong>Force</strong> and his biological knowledge to terraform the world into a paradise. At first, Rivan desired to possess the Darkstaff, but when he learned that it was a malevolent vacuum of power, he became bent on destroying it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the New Sith Wars, Darth Rivan consolidated many dark siders into an army. To circumvent the betrayals common among Sith, he pioneered the creation of Battlelords. This radical process bonded one of Rivan’s Sith commanders—the Battlelord—through the <strong>Force</strong> to his or her troops, such that if subordinates tried to injure or kill their superior, the alchemical bond insured that the traitors would instead be the recipients of the <strong>damage</strong> they intended to inflict.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During a pivotal battle, Rivan simply vanished from the combat zone in a catastrophic and violent way. Legend relates that Rivan at last obtained possession of the Darkstaff that he both craved and feared, and that it created a hyperspace wormhole, known as a <strong>Force Storm,</strong> that annihilated Rivan’s Battlelord army. Caught in the eye of this unnatural tempest, Rivan was flung to a time and place far removed from Almas. He found himself on the planet Ruusan, caught in the War of Light and Dark between Lord Hoth’s Army of Light and Lord Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness. The Darkstaff left Rivan bereft of the <strong>Force,</strong> and when he encountered a <strong>Force-user</strong> of inconsequential power, the Dark Lord was easily dispatched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Under the influence of dark <strong>Force</strong> energies on Almas, the gatekeeper of Darth Rivan’s holocron has been given the ability to function independently and of its own free will, acting as the real Rivan would.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DARTH RIVAN'S HOLOCRON GATEKEEPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium hologram, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft fly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 17 (+3) 15 (+2) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Int +5, Wis +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Deception +7, Insight +6, Perception +4, Persuasion +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Immunities All</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Bocce, Dosh, Honoghran, Huttese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 0 (25 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aura of Malevolence.

Imperial <strong>shadow troopers</strong> might be mistaken for regular <strong>clone troopers,</strong> except that their stealth armor and red visors give them the appearance of demonic silhouettes. They are trained for reconnaissance and occasionally serve as guardians to vital facilities and personnel. Inquisitor Draco reasons that if they’re good enough for the Emperor’s secret Utapau storehouse, they’re good enough for him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unlike that of other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow trooper</strong> armor retains its distinctive pre-Imperial appearance. There is talk of eventually streamlining <strong>shadow trooper</strong> armor, but for now, their scarlet T-visors remain a haunting reminder of Palpatine’s bloody ascension to the rank of Emperor. Like all other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow troopers</strong> cannot be bribed, blackmailed, or seduced. Any such attempt automatically fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>shadow troopers’</strong> scarlet T-visors give the impression of demonic silhouettes, but their coordination and synchronization of movement reminds you that that these clones are highly trained killers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHADOW TROOPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (combat suit)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 23 (5d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 15 (+2) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Perception +4, Stealth +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

When her affections were not reciprocated, love turned to obsession, and Master Kirlocca dismissed her from the academy. Angered at these rejections, Raik became bent on revenge. She attempted to undermine the Jedi by impersonating members of the Jedi Order while publicly performing acts of sabotage and chaos. Muun also learned of the existence of an evil creature called a t'salak, and by kidnapping and impersonating a Jedi, she gained possession of the beast. Successfully fissioning the creature into multiple entities, she attempted to use two t'salaks to turn some Jedi into crazed killers during a peace conference. Her plan failed, but Master Kirlocca lost his life defeating the t'salaks, and Raik escaped.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Raik returned to her base on the planet Tilnes, she learned about the decimation of Jedi throughout the galaxy as a result of Order 66. Her revenge was now denied, but she could still fuel the rumors of the “Jedi Rebellion.” Raik went to Coruscant to confront those responsible for the destruction of the self-righteous <strong>Force-users,</strong> not sure if she should thank them or kill them. That’s when she met Valin Draco. The Inquisitor saw enormous potential in the wild-eyed Dark Jedi and asked her to join him. Raik felt that she had finally found someone who would love her back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Raik has accompanied Draco on various assignments, indulging in the opportunity to hunt Jedi. When Draco travels to Almas, Raik's familiarity with the academy proves essential, as does the t’salak she brought along.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fire-haired woman stalks toward you, clad in a dark version of the Inquisitor’s attire. She appears Human, but something about her says otherwise. Then you see it. Draco’s gaze shows ruthlessness and calculation, but this Dark Jedi’s entrancing, green-slitted pupils harbor only murder and dementia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RAIK MUUN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (human), neutral dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (battle precognition)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 113 (25d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11 (+0) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 13 (+1) 12 (+1) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Cha +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Intimidation +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 11</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting.

The <strong>shadow troopers</strong> have the advantage of darkvision. A few large rocks scattered about the cave can offer concealment, or they can be lifted with the <strong>Force</strong> and thrown at opponents. Anyone standing too close to the openings in the center of the area risks falling over the edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BEHEMOTH FROM BELOW</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At any point when Draco finds himself below half of his hit points, or if his apprentice and <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are dead, he retreats to a back entrance that opens into an immense cavern that is spectacularly lit by bioluminescent, multicolored lichen coating the walls. Draco retreats onto a natural rock overpass bridging a wide chasm that appears as bottomless as it is black. Even in flight, the Inquisitor still tries to push players off the ledge. But Draco is growing desperate, and his connection to Rivan weakens as his resolve does the same. He is prepared to make his last stand here as long as he deprives the heroes of the object they desire—the Qornah Holocron.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, there is one factor Inquisitor Draco hasn’t accounted for. Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper has not been completely forthcoming with him. If the gatekeeper couldn’t retain control of Draco, he planned to summon the real k’kayeh dragon, which has grown to a massive 200 meters (as big as some space slugs) since the Dark Lord first created the monster more than a <strong>thousand years ago.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the gatekeeper is stripped from the holocron, his final howl of rage awakens the k’kayeh and draws it upward. If the gatekeeper is not separated from the holocron, he chooses to summon the beast at this moment. Either way, the behemoth is unleashed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Draco flees onto the bridge formation, he threatens to destroy the Quornah Holocron, holding it out over the chasm as tendrils of <strong>Force lightning</strong> flash from his hands. Though the beast has been released, it is not completely uncontrolled. Still seething with the dark side of the <strong>Force</strong> from his tutelage under the Sith holocron gatekeeper, Draco is able to control the beast—at least enough to keep it from devouring him. Likewise, he bends the massive strikes of <strong>Force lightning</strong> to his will, causing them to lash out at the heroes while he nimbly steps between them. Draco plans to destroy the heroes here, and unless they can defeat him, they will lose</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter begins with Draco entering the room and moving to the middle of the large stone bridge that stretches across this canyon. After the events described in the boxed text below, the heroes should be at the entrance to the cavern, with Draco across the bridge, waiting for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the first heroes enter the cavern where this encounter takes place, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco makes a stand midway on the overpass traversing the black gulf. A red lightsaber hisses in his right hand, angled down and away from him, while he extends the precious holocron over the abyss in his left. Then a sound like rolling thunder causes the caverns to shudder, as if the planet itself were growling in fury. Abruptly, as if the sky’s been turned upside down, two blue bolts of lightning the size of starfighters explode toward you from below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the seething electrical masses smashes into the ceiling high above, producing a shower of man-sized boulders. The other mammoth blue bolt sideswipes the bridge, missing you by a mere meter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On the heels of that familiar, unnatural lightning comes a monster straight out of your nightmares—200 meters of golden sinew and obscenity, led by a gaping maw lined with teeth bigger than the tallest Wookiee. It looks identical to the dreambeast you fought earlier, and for a heartbeat you hope that you’re still dreaming. But this is real, and this leviathan makes the illusion you battled earlier look like a tame womp rat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco, now without the aid of the Sith holocron gatekeeper, has gained some control over both the dreambeast and the <strong>Force lightning</strong> erupting from the abyss below. Before the encounter begins, Draco regains 20 hitpoints from the dark side knowledge he has retained, knowing that he’ll need them in the coming fight. Remember to include any <strong>damage, HP,</strong> or spent <strong>force points</strong> in this encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As a <strong>bonus action,</strong> Inquisitor Draco can force an arc of <strong>Force lightning</strong> lances out at a creature, forcing it to make a <strong>DC 16 Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On a failed <strong>save,</strong> the creature takes <strong>16 ([[/r 3d10[lightning] # Lightning damage]]) damage</strong>, <strong>half</strong> on a success. Additionally, all creatures within<strong> 5 feet </strong>of the <strong>target</strong> take <strong>half</strong> the <strong>damage</strong> as well. As a result, he never uses this against targets in which he is engaged in melee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR DRACO TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco knows that, alone, he could easily be overwhelmed by a group of heroes. As such, he takes a much more defensive position than he did in the previous encounter. He uses the ambient <strong>Force</strong> lightning to keep multiple enemies from getting too close to him each <strong>round.</strong> Similarly, he will use Choke to shut down one hero, letting the k’kayeh dragon do the <strong>attacking</strong> for him (while still shooting an arc of <strong>Force lightning).</strong> If no heroes are engaged in melee, Draco uses his action to dodge, hoping the disadvantage to <strong>attackers</strong> will prevent them from hitting him. Draco uses Saber Reflect when appropriate to deal with any <strong>attacks</strong> that get by his AC, hoping to draw one or two <strong>melee attackers</strong> to him at a time so that he can whittle them down rather than face a barrage from all of the heroes at once.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco will also begin using his Legendary Action abilities as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes deal the killing blow to Draco, he drops the Qornah Holocron at his feet. With a gasp, he goes wide-eyed and tumbles from the side of the bridge into the abyss. As Draco plummets into darkness, the <strong>Force lightning</strong> stops, and the k’kayeh dragon descends into the abyss once more, presumably after the body of the Inquisitor. With Draco defeated and the holocron recovered, the heroes need to escape from the collapsing academy with haste.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two environmental features make this encounter challenging for the heroes. First, most of the combat will take place on a large stone bridge with no railings. Any heroes pushed off of the bridge must attempt to catch themselves or they will fall into the abyss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second, the k’kayeh dragon stretches up to menace the heroes. Though the dragon would normally be far too powerful for them to face, in this encounter, it acts more like an obstacle than a true opponent. The dragon has an <strong>Initiative bonus</strong> of +6 and an AC of 18. If successfully hit by a ranged <strong>attack,</strong> the beast takes a cumulative <strong>1d4 penalty</strong> to its bite <strong>attack</strong> for each ranged <strong>attack</strong> that hits it. (You should make it clear to the heroes that their combined efforts are having a combined effect, giving <strong>ranged attackers</strong> a role in the encounter while melee combatants deal with Draco.) Once per <strong>round,</strong> the dragon snaps at any heroes in the chamber who are not engaged in melee with Draco, making a melee weapon <strong>attack</strong> with a <strong>+8 </strong>to hit. A successful hit deals <strong>16 ([[/r 2d8+7[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to the target and moves the target<strong> 5 feet</strong> in any direction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEAVING THE ECHOES BEHIND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The giant dragon causes major tremors, and the academy’s foundations, already weakened by a major bombardment and <strong>several years</strong> of misuse, start to collapse. This is a good time for the heroes to exit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Describe the ground shaking and falling rocks at random points. Reuse the fallen debris from the Cave-In section a few times as the heroes make their way back up toward the surface. Appropriate points on the map would be the tunnel leading to sublevel 2, the stairs leading up to sublevel 1, and any corridor on sublevel 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes survived their encounter with Draco relatively unscathed, feel free to run more encounters on sublevel 2. For example</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some Believers might have escaped the heroes’ first trip through the level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nighthunter or the t’salak might have survived.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library on sublevel 1 might have some guardian spirits still roaming around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some Dark Lizards might still be stalking the ruins on the top level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These encounters should be run in the corridors, delaying the heroes from escaping and creating a rising sense of urgency. If none of these encounters is appropriate, or if the heroes overcome the challenges easily, they might encounter more pirates as they return to their ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes climb up the turbolift shaft and are out of the ruins, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you run through the ruins of the academy’s ground floor, the remaining walls of the fountain room and the columns in the entry hall collapse around you, showering you with dust. As you leap for the exit out of the academy, huge clouds of dust billow into the air, obscuring your view as the ground quakes and devours the ruins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the dust clears, you could not have imagined how good Almas’ toxin-filled air would feel in your lungs. It’s a good thing you rescued the holocron, because no one will be able to go back down there for a long, long time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Looking away from the falling rubble, you see the familiar buildings of deserted Forard city. You feel like resting a bit before walking back to your ship. You can’t wait to reunite with your uncomfortable bunk bed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Master Denia</strong> will be grateful that you’ve recovered the holocron. You should return to the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>soon, before more Imperial agents come looking for Inquisitor Draco.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes shouldn’t have too much trouble reaching their ship. If it needs repairs, they have to perform the work uninterrupted for a <strong>few hours</strong>. The Imperial dungeon ship that Draco brought is still in the system, accompanied by his Star Destroyer, the <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> but they are outside the comet field. The heroes detect the Imperial ships once they clear the comet field, but the ships are too far out of weapons range to <strong>attack.</strong> If the heroes scan the ships, they identify one as the Assiduous (which they should recognize from the battle over <strong>Bespin</strong>) and the other as a Lictor-class dungeon ship named Revelator. They could not detect the ships on their way in because the Imperials were stationed in Cularin’s shadow. But now, not having received a report from Draco in <strong>several hours</strong>, the Revelator approaches the limits of the system to launch another shuttle. It does not pursue the heroes, but it <strong>attacks</strong> if they are daring enough to come within range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes leave the Cularin system, they can reach the last known coordinates of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. The trip back takes<strong> one day</strong>, giving the heroes time to rest, treat their wounds, and study the holocron. Any <strong>non-Force-sensitive</strong> heroes find the cube unresponsive, but a <strong>force user</strong> can conjure the holocron’s gatekeeper, Master Qornah, who answers a few basic questions but insists on the presence of another Jedi Master.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When they finally approach the Nebulon-B frigate, the heroes receive a communication from <strong>Captain Verana</strong> asking if their mission was successful. He greets them as they dock underneath the large ship and walks them to their quarters. When the heroes are ready, they are instructed to go to the briefing room to meet with <strong>Master Denia</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Denia</strong> asks the heroes for the holocron and activates it. She then listens as the heroes recount their adventure. At the mention of Draco’s name, <strong>Denia </strong>displays a brief look of shock and becomes very pensive thereafter, as if distracted by something far away. Gathering her composure, she states the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This sounds like quite an ordeal you experienced, and whether you follow the Jedi ways or not, you have contributed greatly to the enlightenment of the Force.

During my recovery, I had time to reflect on our goal—to discover the purpose of the Sarlacc Project.</em></p>\n<p><em>While studying at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, I learned about holocrons—recording devices into which Jedi stored their wisdom to pass on to future generations. Some holocrons, such as the prized Tedryn Holocron of Jedi Master Ashka Boda, were tailored toward helping Jedi Masters penetrate the secrets of the Force. Even beings already trained in the Jedi ways, like myself, greatly benefit from such a source of learning.</em></p>\n<p><em>I summoned you because the Force has pulled together threads of knowledge to reveal the location of a holocron similar to the Tedryn. Some time before I traveled to Cato Neimoidia, Master Ashka Boda contacted me with news that he had joined the former Almas Academy student Halagad Ventor in trying to form a network between the scattered Jedi survivors of the destruction of the academy. During the Clone Wars, an orbital bombardment decimated the academy in the Cularin system, and if any artifacts have survived, common sense suggests that they have since been stolen. But the Force tells me that the holocron we require is there.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ve never been to the planet Almas in person, but I knew the headmaster there, a serene Jedi Master named Lanius Qel-Bertuk.

This dead zone is cold and lifeless, and full environment suits are required to survive in it. The area has grown steadily for <strong>centuries</strong> and now has reached the <strong>academy’s</strong> doorstep</p>\n<p><strong>DC15</strong> In the heart of the wasteland is an ancient Sith fortress, which was abandoned about a<strong> thousand years ago</strong>. The wasteland has grown at an estimated radius of <strong>3 feet per year</strong>, though the death of kaluthin was further accelerated recently, starting about <strong>13 years ago</strong> with sabotage by a dark side cult called the Believers. Since the razing of the Almas Academy, however, a radical surge in the dead zone has occurred. The wasteland now encompasses a radius of 3,100 miles, with a trail that leads straight to the ghost town of Forard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC20 It is rumored that the Sith Lord who built the fortress around <strong>1,150</strong> to <strong>1,400 years ago</strong> also created the kaluthin, combining his knowledge of bioengineering with the power of the <strong>Force.</strong> The kaluthin ability to synthesize the atmosphere of an entire planet is still considered an amazing achievement today. Until recently, scientists researched ways of transplanting the glowing grass to other worlds, but met with little success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Intelligence (Lore)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 10 Almas is the fourth and outermost planet in the Cularin system. Over a <strong>thousand years ago</strong>, a plant named kaluthin took root on the icy, lifeless world, nourishing itself from large underground lakes. Over time, the kaluthin synthesized the planet’s poisonous atmosphere (composed in large part of methane and phosphorus) into enough oxygen to sustain carbon-based life. Still, prolonged exposure can be hazardous to one's health due to trace amounts of toxins, and breath masks or atmospheric regulators are strongly recommended.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 15 The local nights on Almas are not determined by the distant twin suns. Wherever kaluthin grow (everywhere except in the dead zone), their phosphorus-filled leaves absorb the moonlight and make the surface of the planet glow. It takes a while for newcomers to adjust to the dusk to dawn cycles, which are determined by the kaluthin’s leaves being either spread open or closed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 20 A century and a half ago, the Jedi established a training academy on Almas. The town of Forard was subsequently built, forming a circle around the Jedi academy. Several sadrin farms were found wherever kaluthin grew. All were recently abandoned, however, shortly after the academy was destroyed. Now the academy ruins and the surrounding town buildings are regularly despoiled by salvagers looking for valuable loot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DC 25 The academy was attacked at the end of the Clone Wars by three starships, which took the resident Jedi by surprise. One was a Cularin Allied Force ship that was brought down by Jedi starfighters and crashed into the academy grounds. Another was a mercenary vessel destroyed by allies of the Jedi. The third was a black starfighter that fled shortly after the assault, possibly carrying the party responsible for the attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes exit hyperspace, read the following text aloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Several hours after leaving the Corellian Run, your starship exits hyperspace at the calculated point just outside the Cularin system. Exactly as you were warned by <strong>Master Denia</strong>, you notice innumerable comets of all shapes and sizes occasionally colliding with each other, forming an enormous cloud around the system. Fortunately, you were supplied with a sensor package that analyzes their erratic patterns and calculates a safe path through the cloud. Once past that danger, another jump must be calculated to avoid flying for <strong>weeks</strong> at sublight speeds. However, this time the calculations are trickier due to large, overlapping gravity wells created by the system’s dense planet cores. But you know people who’ve made the Kessel Run, and this can’t be worse than skirting the Maw cluster. An hour later, you again emerge from hyperspace and the planet farthest from Cularin’s twin suns comes into view, lambent and mysterious: Almas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first thing you notice from orbit is the strange luminescence that emanates from the planet itself. The twin suns are too distant to illuminate the planet, and you are approaching from the side facing away from them. Yet most of the surface emits a faint glow, except for one dark spot where the Jedi academy happens to be located according to your nav computer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ALMAS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As soon as they near Almas, the heroes’ starship sensors start beeping, alerting them to a nearby ship. A modified consular-class cruiser was hiding in orbit close to planet’s moon Dorumaa and is now coming at them fast, with cannons and tractor beams trained on the heroes’ ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since the destruction of the Almas Academy, the pirates of the Red Fury Brotherhood emerged as the dominant corsairs in the Cularin system. Inquisitor Draco cut a deal to have them patrol the orbit of Almas while he investigates the darkness saturating the planet. Policing duties have fallen to one of the Red Fury’s most hardhearted and arrogant swashbucklers, the pirate Reddjak. His menacing scarlet vessel, the Blood Brother, tries to ensnare and board the heroes’ ship within moments of its arrival.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SEEING RED</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LANDING</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nav computer instructs the heroes to land near the abandoned cluster of buildings formerly comprising the city of Forard. There is no spaceport control to direct them—the landing beacons have been extinguished for close to <strong>two years.</strong> Landing the ship is not difficult, since the terrain around the town is flat for hundreds of miles. However, if the ship was damaged during the “Seeing Red” encounter, the heroes should make a few <strong>Intelligence (PIloting) checks</strong> to land without incident.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ship’s sensors detect only a few life forms in the vicinity. The planet’s atmosphere is cold and has a very high oxygen concentration. The air contains traces of toxins (such as methane and phosphorus), and a <strong>DC 15 Survival check </strong>reveals that the heroes should wear breath masks, at least while outside the ruins, to avoid being affected.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If they ignore this warning or fail the <strong>Survival check,</strong> have the players make a <strong>DC 15 Constitution saving throw,</strong> if they fail they take <strong>[[/r 2d8[poison] # Poison damage]] damage</strong> and take one level of exhaustion from the toxic atmosphere. In addition, due to the large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere, players regain all their hit dice upon a long rest instead of only half.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The academy ruins are located in the city center, and since kaluthin doesn’t grow in the immediate vicinity, the heroes must use glowrods (or ignited lightsabers) to light the way. Heroes who are <strong>force sensitive </strong>automatically detect a strong presence of the dark side as soon as they get just over half a mile towards the academy. Due to the dark side interference, the Affect Mind, Mind Trick and <strong>Sense Emotion force</strong> <strong>powers</strong> do not function.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SQUIBS . . . WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE SQUIBS?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nearly circular city of Forard escaped the fate of the Jedi academy around which it was built. Citizens of the urban sprawl watched in horror and awe as fire rained down from the sky with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, utterly annihilating the academy. But if the people thought they were safe after this precision strike, they were dead wrong. With the destruction of the academy, a series of mysterious calamities befell the city, and now it remains all but lifeless.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Whether the heroes land in this area as part of the encounter with the Red Fury Brotherhood or come to it afterward, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The city is empty of men, women, and children. Hostile winds whip through the lifeless streets and between the alleyways of abandoned buildings. Unlike most of the planet, here the unchecked kaluthin has taken over, growing up to 6 feet tall in some parts of the city. And yet, the plant fails to mask strewn debris and the occasional decomposing body—the calling cards of looters and bandits who plundered the city after the unexpected attack almost <strong>two years ago.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you walk through the discarded remnants of old lives, you notice the empty twin buildings housing the local children’s school. To your left, you see faded graffiti on the wall, below a sign that reads “Remembrance Hall.” A collective chill runs down your spines as you make out suspiciously red letters that say, “DEATH TO THE UNFAITHFUL.\" When you get within a 300 feet of the academy ruins, you realize that all the kaluthin inside this radius has died off. This area is as dead as the entire planet was millennia ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If a hero makes a successful<strong> DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> with <strong>disadvantage,</strong> they notice that they are being watched, though he can’t determine who or what is spying on them. He catches only shadows or overhears noises of jostled metal and debris. These are Sith worshippers and their Dark Lizard pets that, up until the bombardment, had relegated themselves to Almas’ Sith fortress and its immediate vicinity, where the lingering presence of the dark side used to be strongest. The heroes will encounter a pack of Dark Lizards before entering the Almas Academy and the Sith “Believers” later within the ruins’ obscured depths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes make their way to the city center, they reach the outer buildings that surround the Almas Academy—or what used to be the academy (see the map of the academy area on page 11). Extrapolated from the Coruscant Jedi Temple’s original design, only a few crumbling walls of the Jedi learning center are still visible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes near what might have been the entrance to the academy grounds, a cacophony of barely intelligible voices assails their ears. When the heroes get even closer, they spot three rotund beings in space suits towering over five aliens that look like rabid canines with blue fur. A member of each group is engaged in a tug-of-war over what looks like the upper half of a tarnished silver protocol droid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Ged your unholy pseudopoda off dis Holy Artifact, Zquib-thing,” the big one says.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The little guy retorts, “From our dead, cold paws, ugly Ugor fiend-being! We did the location finding of this silver-ish, prettisome treasure pre-secondary!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“It is unfortunate,” the half-droid says, “that Jedi Master Lanius never programmed me for a denouement of this particular design.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Hey, byu!” One of larger ones yells, popping off its helmet and turning part of its flabby amoebic body into an arm to wave you over “Hey byu, tell Zquib zinners we find dis Holy Artifact infinitely dimes infinitely before dem. Blease!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Scavengers. Given the scum that usually shows up in the wake of a battle or planetary catastrophe, these foragers seem relatively harmless. This should be evident to the heroes based on the exchanges they overhear. Based on the droid’s reference to his relationship with Jedi Master Lanius (whom <strong>Master Denia</strong> mentioned to the heroes), they should realize that the droid might have information that can help them with their mission. If the heroes do not catch on immediately, feel free to offer them other incentives to recover the droid for themselves, such as having the droid mention knowledge of the academy’s ruins (“This never would have happened if I’d stayed in the ruins!”) and so forth. When the heroes approach, all parties react with a degree of restrained but visible hope, each trying to share its side of the story before the others.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SplrMuck, the unicellular Ugor holding the droid’s left arm, explains that his group found the droid first, fair and square, dragging it out from the Almas Academy ruins. SplrMuck set the droid down in front of the academy entrance for just a second when he saw the heroes’ ship set down nearby. SplrMuck’s story, if true, seems to be news to Jiminaldomabbramsti (or Jimi)—the feisty Squib with a death grip on the droid’s right arm—and his furry compatriots. They work for the Squib salvager Squeerie, and Jimi insists that no Ugors were around at the time he found this “treasure” near the temple entrance. Possession is ninehundred-and-ninety-nine one-thousandths of High Squibbian Law, so if SplrMuck set the droid down, for whatever reason, it’s fair game. By contrast, Ugors have turned garbage gathering into a religion, and Ugorian Divine Law decrees that the first being to find a piece of junk consecrates it with his slime on contact, a mark of ownership instantly identifiable and respected by any other Ugor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As for the half-droid himself, he explains respectfully that he is 7A39, or SevenAy, a former protocol droid for the Almas Academy. The heroes should not only feel inclined toward helping the hapless droid, but also recognize that SevenAy might have crucial information about the academy’s sublevels and perhaps the holocron they’re after.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes have multiple challenges in their interactions with the scavengers, but only acquiring SevenAy or a special datacron is critical to the success of their mission. The heroes must negotiate with the Squib and Ugor parties for the droid. The following challenges show how the heroes can affect the outcome of the encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Primary Challenge: The heroes must either save 7-A39 so that they can question the protocol droid or obtain a datacron that will grant access to the computer inside the academy's control room. Although the scavengers begin the encounter hostile toward each other, each group begins with an attitude of indifferent toward the heroes, whom they hope can solve their dilemma. As both groups are really less interested in SevenAy than in getting as many credits as they can, they are receptive to any deal the heroes try to spin in exchange for the droid. If pressed, SplrMuck will give up his claim to SevenAy for 2,000 credits, and Jimi will settle for any spare breath masks the heroes might have (the Squibs didn’t realize that the Almas atmosphere was technically poisonous). Once the heroes have acquired SevenAy, the Squibs throw in a net, free of charge, so that one of the heroes can carry the half-droid on his or her back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the characters don’t barter for SevenAy, the datacron can be used instead to splice into the academy’s computer. However, the datacron won’t offer the same advice that SevenAy can. The droid has intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the academy, even after the attacks, and can provide directions and explanations of how some systems inside the academy work—for example, that the backup generator can power only one sublevel at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: In addition to obtaining components for their ship, the heroes can haggle with the scavengers for other items. The Squibs have the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a battering ram</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a box of eight glowrods</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a beat-up children’s holobook of Busteromuchmacho and the Vermillion Shadow (Vol. 3 in the Squib Jedi series)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a broken lightsaber that belonged to Dorv'Tilsta, the Padawan of Master Vhiin’Thorla, which will be of use to the heroes later</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Ugors have these items:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a clone trooper utility belt (with a medpac and 50 ft of Fibercord cable)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a Stokhli spray stick (identifiable with a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>a “holy holocron”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes show excitement over the holocron, the Ugors demand, in exchange, either a sizeable sum (5,000 credits) or something precious to the heroes. If the characters acquire the holocron, they quickly realize that it’s a “holocron” in name only—a cheap marketing ploy used to boost the appeal of everyday datacrons.

Their fur ranges from deep red to brilliant blue, and they have large yellow or red eyes. They are known for their fearless curiosity, shameless overconfidence, and love of haggling. They are enthusiastic scavengers, and often find fistfuls of credits in the detritus that others discard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ugors are single-celled beings. However, that single cell grows to be 6 feet across. An Ugor can extrude as many as thirty distinct pseudopodia, which serve as limbs, manipulators, or sensory organs. Ugors often have a “default” appearance, roughly humanoid, to deal with multicelled beings. Ugors see scavenging as their business and their religion. They are often selfish, unfriendly by nature, and concerned only with garbage and food. Lying and cheating are Ugor virtues, and they are highly competitive with Squibs, whom they consider their mortal enemies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SALVAGER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Squib or Ugor), lawful neutral</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (fiber armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 33 (6d8+6)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 14 (+2) 12 (+1) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Investigation +4, Lore +4, Technology +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 10</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic and Squib or Ugor</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Techcasting.

The heroes’ only warning before the assault is a spine-chilling snarl and SplrMuck’s gurgling vociferation, “Holy irrebducible garbágina!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE BELIEVERS' PETS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the scavengers were receptive to the heroes before, they consider the heroes comrades now that they have shed dark side blood together. After killing the Dark Lizards, if the heroes had not already secured the items they wanted from the scavengers, the Squibs and Ugors turn them over with glee—at a meager 50 credits each. There’s nothing they wouldn’t do for a friend, after all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes have secured their prize (either the half-droid or the datacron), they can head directly into the Almas Academy ruins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTERING THE RUINS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do some reconnaissance outside, they can see that the ruins of eight rectangular buildings surround the tower like ragged teeth. The grounds between them and the main building used to be gardens, but are now littered with ferrocrete hunks of blasted wall and the remains of a military ship that crashed into the north side of the tower. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Soon, you pass the outer buildings and grounds that surround the academy proper. The remains of the circular structure are immediately identifiable as Coruscani in design. The majestic white marble tower lies toppled on the ground.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once you pass the yawning entrance, where the 16 foot-high double doors were ripped from their hinges by someone who valued only their material worth, you find yourselves in the entry hall. Even with all the surrounding devastation, the wonder of this place remains palpable. The few interior walls still standing are also made of white Selonian marble, lined with thick veins of silver that form into knots where wall and floor meet. Inlaid cases carved into the entry hall walls are set at about 3 feet off the floor. Dust-free spots inside them show that their contents were stolen rather recently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Only some sections of the ground floor remain accessible. Most of the corridors were blocked when the upper floors caved in during the bombardment. You must make your way over or under a row of once-dazzling columns at the hall center, now shattered into pathetic fragments. At the other end, past the cracked bust of a venerable Twi’lek Jedi, the only unobstructed path leads to the fountain chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once there, you find yourselves in a large, circular room, half of which is completely caved in. There are five marble benches lined up along the curving wall on the left and an exit at the other end, which leads to another dark corridor. While the farthest half is filled with debris, in the middle of the room sits a magnificent fountain. From its center extends an impressive sculpture of a large humanoid hand, palm out in a welcoming gesture. The work of art is cracked from the impacts it suffered during the <strong>attack.</strong> The fountain waters stopped bubbling a long time ago, and at the bottom of the dried-up pool is a dark, viscous substance that seems to slightly alter its shape. Must be a trick of the light. There seems to be nothing of interest in this former contemplation chamber.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes go directly to the exit, skip to the next encounter. If at least one hero tries to touch the black substance, add the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you approach the black substance that lies at the center of the fountain, a tendril of ooze lashes out faster than the eye can see, and a profound cold engulfs you for a second. Before anyone realizes what has happened, the puddle of ooze disappears down the fountain water shaft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each hero in a square that is adjacent to the ooze is <strong>attacked</strong> by one tendril. The <strong>attack</strong> is considered a <strong>surprise attack</strong> and cannot act in response. Have any adjacent players make a <strong>DC 17 Dexterity saving throw</strong> and deals <strong>[[/r 1d8[psychic] # Psychic damage]] damage</strong>. The creature is a t’salak and will be encountered in the lower levels of the academy. It has been lying in wait as a sort of sentry, but it doesn’t use its <strong>powers</strong> on the heroes just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CAVE-IN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The right path on the ground floor is pretty clear-cut. The holomap contained within SevenAy or the datacron is useful only once the heroes reach the sublevels. Still, if the heroes ask, the droid reveals that the inaccessible rooms on the ground floor used to be offices and classrooms, the lightsaber training room, and the grand lecture hall. The only way downstairs is via an empty turbolift shaft located past the fountain chamber and to the left. But before they reach it, the heroes’ passing causes a wall to cave in—a wall that was sustaining the ceiling by a hairpin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The falling debris causes the players to make a<strong> DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong> deals <strong>[[/r 4d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> with a successful <strong>save</strong> taking<strong> half damage</strong>. Any hero who fails the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> gets caught beneath a lump of ferrocrete. A successful <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check </strong>will remove the debris.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes survive, they reach the turbolift shaft. It shows signs of recent activity, and heroes who make a <strong>DC 19 Wisdom (Survival) check </strong>will know that there were several humanoids who passed through here. If they succeed in a <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> they also know that it was only in the past <strong>few days</strong>. There are no handholds inside the shaft. To descend, the heroes must climb down or use an item such as a fibercord rope. The turbolift shaft descends for <strong>50 feet</strong> before reaching the first sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Note, surviving the cave in and entering the first sublevel of the Academy should be considered a level-up milestone.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 2: DOMAIN OF EVIL</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the ruined ground floor above had at least some reflected light streaming in, the underground level is pitch black. As the heroes scurry down the empty shaft, they must rely on their own darkvision, glowrods, lightsabers or other sources of light to guide the way. Beneath the heroes is a rubble pile that fell inside the shaft, blocking the path north to the vehicle hangar, but the south exit out of the turbolift is clear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once outside the lift shaft, the heroes find themselves at the intersection of two corridors that form an “L” shape (see the map of sublevel 1). A thin coat of dust covers the floor, disturbed in places where several beings have recently traveled. The walls are constructed of reinforced white duraplast. The corridor going east leads to several small study chambers and the remains of a control room, before being blocked by a cave-in (see “Control Room,” below). The corridor going straight (south) has two blast doors (see “Generator Room,” below) and turns left about 75 feet down (see “Library,” below).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONTROL ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All meditation chambers (each about 10 feet wide by 25 feet long) are empty, so the main feature of this northern area is the control room. There is no power to this level, so the blast door must be opened manually. Heroes can jury-rig an external power source (such as a datapad or power cell) on a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. They can also pry open the door on a <strong>DC 20 Strength check </strong>or simply break it down (AC 15, 18 hit points). If the heroes enter the control room, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The blast door yields, and you find yourselves in a dark, dank room about 10 feet by 60 feet. On the opposite wall is a large, cracked transparisteel window with a view blocked by enormous boulders and slag. The far side of the room is also filled from floor to ceiling with rubble where the wall and window were not strong enough to hold back the collapsing academy structure. Below the window is a bank of consoles and computers; some have been damaged, with broken screens and severed wires hanging from underneath. But one console seems intact. It has a standard input for datapads and astromech droids.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes might have turned on the power to this level (see “Generator Room,” below). If not, they can power up the console with an external source on a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. If 7-A39 is with them, the droid suggests it to the heroes. If the <strong>check</strong> fails by <strong>5 or more</strong>, the console short-circuits and requires extensive repairs. If the <strong>check</strong> succeeds, the computer turns on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the Jedi had locked down the system with restricted access, so the heroes have to plug in either SevenAy (at his suggestion), the datacron they obtained from the Ugors or perform a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. The information that can be accessed includes a map of sublevel 1, descriptions of functions for each room (the most important of which is the library), and a dated log showing what vehicles were borrowed from the hangar (located behind the debris-blocked window) and by whom.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Access to the map shows a stairway leading down at the end of the corridor outside the control room, but the heroes noticed earlier that this route is blocked. They must circle the perimeter of the meditation rooms and arrive at the other side of the blocked passageway to access these stairs (unknown to the heroes, that stairway is also blocked by debris; see “Storage Rooms,\" below). The last log entry, dated around the same time as the attack on the Almas Academy, shows that all vehicles were evacuated from the hangar due to an emergency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To access information about the second sublevel, the heroes must succeed at a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. (See the map of sublevel 2 on page 19. Draw a version of the map that has no labels, and show it to the players.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can issue routine commands, such as turning on the power and opening unlocked blast doors, for either sublevel, but they can do so for only one sublevel at a time. If they turn on the power, the ceiling lights flicker on in the corridor outside. However, the lights are very dim and strobe unpredictably. Be sure to describe this phenomenon to unnerve the heroes as they move about the sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GENERATOR ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halfway across the corridor, on the west side wall, are two blast doors. If the heroes turned on the power in the control room, the doors whisk open with the push of a button. If not, they need to be powered up using an external source or forced (see “Control Room,” above). Behind both doors, the rooms are of equal size, roughly 20 feet by 50 feet at its largest points. The first room used to be a repair and maintenance area. Salvagers have picked it clean, but some pieces of junk are still lying around, including empty fuel containers, damaged repair tools, and all kinds of nuts, bolts, and hull plates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second room houses the academy’s power generator, a huge cylindrical turbine. Close inspection reveals that it is damaged beyond salvation. A smaller turbine nearby is the backup generator, and it is mostly intact. It can be powered on from the computer in the control room or by connecting a datapad directly to it and issuing the activation commands. The backup generator has only enough juice to power one level of the academy at a time, and since the top floors no longer exist, the heroes can use it to power one of the two sublevels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once activated, the backup generator will run for <strong>six hours</strong> before shutting down for a recharge. But the heroes won’t know this, so you can surprise them with this fact once the approximate time has lapsed (or at any particularly dramatic moment). The largely empty room also has a functioning repulsor sled, which the heroes can use to haul their gear around or as a battering ram to beat down doors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIBRARY</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The southern corridor parallels the one to the north, where the control room is located, except that it is not blocked by debris. This corridor is 110 feet long. Along its left (north) wall are numerous doors that lead to more meditation rooms, and in the center of the opposite (south) wall is a single door. The heroes can ignore the doors, swing left around the outside of the meditation chambers, and go directly toward the stairwell (see “Storage Rooms,\" page 14). Each meditation room is 10 feet by 25 feet and totally empty aside from a few personal effects, now caked with dust, that were left behind in a hurry. These inexpensive items (not worth more than 5 credits) might include a personal groomer, a planetary landscape holo-mag, and a recording rod loaded with relaxing music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most important area of sublevel 1 is the library, located directly across from the southern meditation rooms. The blast door to the library is locked, but it must be forced or powered on (see “Control Room,\" above) before a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong> can bypass the lock.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library is 40 foot by 40 foot room. If the heroes expect to find hints about the holocron that <strong>Master Denia</strong> sent them to retrieve, they will be greatly disappointed. Half the library has been blown away by blaster fire, while the rest has fallen victim to looters, Sith cultists, Almasians, and, finally, Inquisitor Valin Draco. Draco learned the specific hidden location of the Qornah Holocron from Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper and took the ancient teaching apparatus down to the deepest sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the Jedi library, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This library isn’t as large as its austere counterpart on Coruscant, but the ruination that greets you is no less dismaying. Even in dim light, you can make out a room that once was filled from floor to ceiling with shelves that housed hundreds of holobooks overflowing with Jedi wisdom. Now, the repository has been pulverized into dust by blaster fire, and the shelves rest toppled at precarious angles throughout the chamber, shattered against research stations and the marble floor. The shelves are kept company by overturned chairs and damaged computers spitting sparks. About 8 feet above you is an open second floor, where even more despoiled shelves, holobooks, and datacards lie. More bloodscrawled graffiti again attests to cultist desecration. The second floor has a catwalk that cannot be reached without a hoversled. Beneath the walkway ledge, at the eastern wall, a wooden door has been splintered open. Framing it are two bronzium busts, presumably of noble Jedi, one of them decapitated. A small plaque identifies the bust as Jedi Master Qornah. The head lies on the floor, severed in half. Oddly, the inside of the sculpture appears to have sheltered something cubical.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes inspect the bust of Master Qornah, they notice a hidden compartment that is in the shape of a cube 4 inches to a side—just the right size for a Jedi holocron, as described by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. At the time of the attack on the academy, the Jedi librarian was studying the Qornah Holocron and quickly tucked it away at the first sign of danger. The Sith holocron gatekeeper told Draco exactly where to find the Qornah Holocron, and the Inquisitor cleaved the bust and claimed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The splintered east door leads into a study where older documents were held. Unlike datacards, flimsiplast burns easily (even more so in Almas’ oxygen-rich atmosphere), so the destruction here is worse. The study also served as the analysis room, and destroyed computers sit on collapsed desks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Behind the west wall is another room, hidden behind a bookshelf, with no visible entrance. The heroes can determine the existence of the secret room by comparing the map (which combines the three rooms of the library into one large room with no walls or doors) to the size and shape of the actual room. The heroes might also notice the distance between the library door and either end of the corridor outside. A successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> reveals that a hidden room exists behind the west wall, but not how to gain entrance. A successful <strong>DC 20 Wisdom (Insight)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Insight) check</strong> to sense surroundings with the force reveals the entrance. Otherwise, a successful<strong> DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to search the wall—coupled with a lot of patience—reveals the mechanism that activates the shelf.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door has to be powered on or forced (see “Control Room,\" page 12). If the door is powered on, a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (security kit) check </strong>allows the heroes to bypass the lock. Failing the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5</strong> or more triggers a silent alarm, which alerts <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> on sublevel 2. Forcing the door automatically triggers the alarm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>QUOTH OF RIVAN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes find a way inside the secret archive room, they stumble upon a grisly scene. Approximately a dozen corpses of different species, all in various states of decomposition, lie scattered about the room. A descending stairway is in plain view at the other end. When the heroes jury-rig the secret door, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the blast door whooshes open, the unmistakable odor hits you like a punch from a Barabel shockboxer: decaying flesh. Strewn before you are about twenty cadavers representing the gamut of alien anatomy and osteology, from Besalisk to Dug to Pinurquian. Judging from the death grip that the deceased have on their weapons, you surmise that two different parties met here a while ago, possibly to cut a deal or as rivals of some sort, and wound up wiping each other out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You spot the descending stairway on the other side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This stairway leads to the archives level below and was reserved exclusively for Jedi Masters. (There was a backup stairway access farther north that was sealed up like a bunker, but it is now blocked to the heroes, anyway). To reach it, the heroes must traverse the obstacle course of corpses. A successful <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, giving <strong>advantage</strong> if they inspect the room before enter, lets them notice motion sensors along the walls in the center of the room, a failsafe installed by the Imperials. If the heroes do not notice the sensors, they automatically trip them, and the blast door comes crashing down. See the 'Army of Darkness' section below if this occurs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While tiptoeing through the archive room, if the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>—perhaps to see what valuables or weapons the dead bodies possess—they notice a scrap of durasheet at the center of the north wall. If they try to get a closer look, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A cold breeze from the opened blast door behind you whips into the repository, sweeping up the burnt ashes of ancient Jedi texts. One item stands out, however. At a cursory glance, it appears to be nothing more than a scrap of durasheet, except that it seems to glow eerily. You head over to inspect it and find that it contains a solitary passage, written in a language you don’t understand. You lift the unexpectedly heavy fragment, and among the only laser-pen burned words written in a recognizable tongue are two defiled parts of a name: DA-TH R-V-N.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The scrap is all that’s left of a tome that belonged to the Sith Lord Darth Rivan. If the heroes have SevenAy with them, the droid can translate the text. It was referred to by Rivan as “the creed of ruin” and is written in Sith. SevenAy translates as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This appears to be a dead language. Yes, definitely—the Sith tongue is such a peculiar one. The passage appears to . . . oh my. Quite a bleak extract. It reads:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>‘There is no passion . . . there is solely obsession.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no knowledge. There is solely conviction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is no purpose. There is solely will.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is nothing . . .

In the library outside, shelves that were still standing shatter as they crash to the floor. The archive room's blast doors slam closed, casting the room into utter darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes do not trip the sensors or read the text, proceed to sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARMY OF DARKNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes are inside the archive room when the doors shut, they participate in the following encounter. If any heroes are elsewhere at the time, they will not be able to get inside until the encounter is over. The heroes have triggered a trap involving powerful parasites that animate the corpses of the dead in this room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper convinced Draco to release a two <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> parasites in the library archive room, where their<strong> telekinetic powers</strong> seemingly bring the corpses to undead life. If any of the heroes fails a <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they are affected by the surprised condition as the encounter begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter the area, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An unexpected chill runs through your spine, and you hear moans coming from somewhere behind you. Impossibly, the cadavers that were littering the floor earlier are now shambling toward your group. One of them vaguely resembles a Kel Dor. Many of the corpses hold blaster pistols in bony hands that are blemished with chunks of spoiled flesh. You have to go through them to reach the stairs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GUARDIAN SPIRIT (2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Called guardian spirits due to primitive cultures’ belief that they were the spirits of the dead come back to life, these creatures are actually parasites with telekinetic abilities. The two parasites can each inhabit one corpse at a time (the Guardian Spirit statblock), giving the body a semblance of undead animation. Simultaneously, each parasite can also reanimate up to two other corpses without actually being in their bodies (the Animated Coprse statblock), but they do so less efficiently, and only to help kill the heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The parasites cannot live outside of a host body for long. If the heroes kill a host body, its parasite inhabits one of the remaining animated corpses, turning it into a guardian spirit. If there are no animated corpses close enough to inhabit, the parasite has nowhere to go and is destroyed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These cadavers are actually made up of two distinct groups: the salvagers known as the Stalfonauts and bounty hunters led by the Kel Dor Jacen Yar, who had been out to capture Jedi survivors of the orbital bombardment. The two parties ran into each other in the academy library and wound up killing each other in the archive room. Now, controlled by the parasites like string puppets, their skeletal remains remember nothing of their former lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You’re surrounded by the approaching corpses. Along with their putrefied organic remains, the dark side drips from the reanimated cadavers like saliva from a predatory nexu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dancing light fills the cavernous eye sockets of their decomposing general as the Kel Dor corpse levels its blaster pistol at you.

If there are none within 30 feet, the parasites dissipate with a dying howl. Heroes need only wait a moment until the blast doors open to have easy access to the stairway leading down to sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library archive room contains shelves along the walls, a few desks in the middle, and a large table on the north side (where Rivan’s document is resting).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After the heroes neutralize the infected corpses, they can proceed down the staircase. If some heroes were trapped outside the archive room during the encounter, the blast door becomes unlocked <strong>10 minutes</strong> after the sensors were tripped. The stairway leads to the second sublevel of the Almas Academy. Once the heroes descend the stairs, proceed to sublevel 2, below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STORAGE ROOMS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the end of the corridor, past the meditation rooms and library, the heroes can turn left. At the other (north) end of this corridor, another cave-in blocks the utility staircase leading down, which the heroes might have seen on the map or learned about from SevenAy. Unfortunately, unless they want to spend a lot of time digging through the rocks (It would take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong> of hard labor), the utility staircase is not accessible. The heroes might give up or look for another way down (see “Library,\" above).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the corridor, halfway to the utility stairway, are two blast doors. They are unlocked but need to be powered on (see “Control Room,\" above). The first room was a storage space for supplies— anything other than food that was needed by a small, self-contained community such as the Almas Academy. This room was heavily pillaged by thieves and salvagers, who left little behind but empty containers. Describe various containers of soap and torn articles of clothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they also notice two surprisingly light, tiny strongboxes with each strongbox is 8 cubic inches in size, can fit in the palm of most people's hands and are made of smooth, black iron. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> reveals that the containers are made of Mandalorian iron, which was believed to be impenetrable by the <strong>Force.</strong> If the <strong>check</strong> beats the <strong>check</strong> by an additional <strong>5</strong>, the heroes also know that the claim is false— the iron cannot stop the <strong>Force,</strong> but the strong alloy is resistant to many types of energy. The boxes have a very strong lock, equivalent to an ultrahigh security lock and opening them requires a <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second room is where the Jedi received and kept their food supplies. Most food has been stolen; the rest spoiled long ago. In the southwest corner of the room is a small kitchen where the residents prepared meals and processed foods. Describe some unidentifiable blackened mounds of rubbish, leftover kitchen appliances, a heating unit, a broken-down refrigeration unit, various utensils, and small spice containers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUBLEVEL 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This sublevel can be reached only via the staircase in the library’s secret archive room. The other staircase down is blocked (see “Storage Rooms,” above). Upon reaching this area, the heroes immediately feel a deep unease that tempts them to turn back. <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> heroes must make a <strong>DC 15 Charisma saving throw</strong> or suffer the effects of the <strong>Curse force power </strong>when using Light aligned <strong>force powers</strong>. The effect lasts as long as they are on this sublevel. Expending <strong>2 force points</strong> or a <strong>1st level force slot</strong> will negate this effect. Also, the Force Sight and<strong> Sense Force force powers</strong> do not function within range of the dark side nexus that has developed here due to Rivan’s lasting influence. Species that rely on the <strong>force</strong> to see such as Miraluka are unaffected by the dark side interference for the purposes of vision.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Encounters are labeled on the map but don’t have to be followed in the sequence presented. The encounters marked “Crazed Believers” and \"Dreambeast\" can happen in any number of rooms at your discretion. You can decide that all unused rooms are empty or permanently locked, or you can detail them as you wish (see the note block below for suggestions).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SUBLEVEL 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sublevel 2 contains a number of rooms that are not described in this adventure. You can choose to have them empty or locked, or you can detail them as desired. Use the following as quick examples:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Surgical Bay: The walls are sterile white. The room reeks of bleach and, faintly, mildew. A half-dozen tables clutter the center. Optionally, a blast door leads to a smaller nursery room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Research Laboratory: Here, countertops and transparisteel cabinets contain various instruments and decayed samples of vegetation (such as lichens, fungi, kaluthin, and so on).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Meeting Room: This room contains several chairs and a large oval table with a broken holoprojector on top. Jedi Masters held important meetings here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WEAPONS ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This room was visited recently, but the blast door controls were destroyed. Opening the door requires <strong>1 hour</strong> and a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes take the time to repair the door and open it, they find something surprising: a blaster shooting range. After all, lightsaber wielding Jedi have to practice their shooting skills, too. If the sublevel has power, several holographic targets appear when the heroes enter the room, startling them. There are representations of Gungans, Jawas, Squibs, and various small beasts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another blast door leads to a back room. If the heroes have not restored power and unlocked the doors to sublevel 2, they must open the blast door manually (see “Control Room,\" above). If they do so, they find that the back room is an armory. Transparent plexi on the ground shields a small stream that runs along just under floor level. This room has 7 usable blaster pistols and 20 power cells. Everything else has either been stolen or rusted beyond use.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>REFRESHER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a fairly standard washroom for both men and women. It contains effluvial rinsers as well as refreshers. Along the floor runs a narrow natural stream, covered by transparent plexi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CRAZED BELIEVERS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the west arch leading to the underground park, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the first of many crazed Humans who wander this level, looking for blood. Feel free to run this encounter more than once in any of the labeled rooms.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Critical Challenge: The heroes must defeat the Believers cultists, who have fallen under the influence of the nearby t’salak. Most cultists have killed each other already, but the few remaining groups (as many as needed, in your judgment) wander about and <strong>attack</strong> the heroes on sight. They have been exposed to the t’salak’s touch so many times that the rage it induces is effectively a form of permanent madness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Auxiliary Challenge: The heroes might try to subdue one or more Believers without killing them. They can accomplish this by grappling them and tying them up, stunning them with blasters, or rendering them unconscious. However, this doesn’t cure their madness, and as soon as they recover, the Believers will <strong>attack</strong> again. They must be alleviated of their delirium to be of any use. To do this, the heroes must make a DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) to have the followers calm down. If the players provide a convincing scenario through roleplaying, give them <strong>advantage.</strong> If the <strong>Restoration force power</strong> is used, the follower's delirium is also lifted while the <strong>Calm Emotions force power</strong> will also temporarily restore their sanity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Award: Alleviating the raging madness in one or more Believers provides the heroes with some information. The grateful victims negotiate their release by giving up details on the t’salak. They know where it is and what it does, but they do not know how to defeat it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter can be repeated several times throughout sublevel 2, but each time, only one group of Believers <strong>attacks</strong> the heroes. Use as many times as you feel appropriate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter a room labeled “Crazed Believers,” read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you turn the corner, you hear a cry of incoherent rage and see several beings lunge at you. They have demented looks in their eyes and are foaming at the mouth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BELIEVERS CULTISTS (3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Believers cult is a group of Sith worshippers that got its start in the Cularin system. They are males and females of different humanoid species, and they come from all walks of life. Some are even trained in the <strong>Force.</strong> They were aided in their organization by the Sith scholar Murk Lundi, and they had grown into a formidable <strong>force</strong> by the time of the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ones encountered on this sublevel have been driven mad by repeated <strong>attacks</strong> from the t’salak. They are encountered in small groups, though, since two large groups of Believers in the same room would kill each other. Many Believers have fallen victim to their crazed companions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BELIEVER CULTIST</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (any), neutral dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 12</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 41 (9d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 9 (-1) 7 (-2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances energy, kinetic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 9</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galactic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'salak Madness.

Refer to the sublevel 2 section of the adventure and the accompanying map for descriptions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>UNDERGROUND PARK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All water on Almas is underground, so the academy’s Jedi custodians reasoned that building an underground park with a running stream would be in tune with the will of the <strong>Force.</strong> The stream was discovered while digging the academy foundations. Instead of diverting it, the Jedi requested that the architects integrate the stream into the design—it was they who had intruded on the water’s natural course, after all. The Jedi then planted local trees and kaluthin and created a garden around the stream. Occasionally, they took blind coboko fish out of the pond that formed in the park center, adding them to the academy menu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of course, all the park vegetation is now dead, blackened by the intense presence of the dark side. The park also contains several bodies of Believers who managed to find the secret stairwell in the library and turned viciously on one another after encountering the t’salak. At the center of the room, beside the pool, is a large pump used to force water to the levels above. It looks like it hasn’t functioned in a long time. The heroes don’t have much time to admire the scenery, however. When they reach the park center, read the following text:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You walk into the impressive chamber, crossing a bridge than runs over a clear and soothing stream. To your left is a large pond, beyond which is an artistic elevation made of simple mud and rock. Disharmoniously, dead vegetation and dead bodies surround it all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you take in your surroundings, your companions suddenly disappear from view, and you are alone. Solid walls seem to have materialized out of nowhere and separated all of you, at the same time blocking the entrance from which you came. You feel a deep sense of dread when a cruel figure from your past appears right in front of you—someone you never imagined you would see again. You look around for a way out, but your feet don’t respond. You try to cry out, but the attempt yields no sound. As if in slow motion, the heartless figure prepares to <strong>attack.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter is similar to Luke’s experience inside the cave on Dagobah. Each hero finds him- or herself face to face with his or her worst nightmare. The heroes are caught in a combination of a mind trick (which makes them believe that they cannot walk away or speak out) and a <strong>Force illusion</strong> (which makes them believe that they are facing an old enemy).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For each hero, choose a character or creature that poses a threat and has some significance to that hero. It could be an enemy, living or dead, from a previous adventure or even from the current adventure. It could also be someone from the hero’s past (for instance, an unlikable former employer or a cruel family member). Determine the appropriate encounter for each hero in advance, without worrying about statistics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The effects of the dark side nexus permeating this place, in combination with the influence of the t’salak (which feeds on the heroes’ feelings of hate and fear), create this <strong>Force illusion</strong>. Heroes who make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> realize that their enemy is an illusion, but this knowledge does not dispel the illusion. The twist is that behind each “illusion” hides one of the other heroes. The trap is designed to cause the heroes to fight each other unknowingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Prior to the adventure, ask the players for their character sheets, and record their most important scores (<strong>weapon damage dice</strong>, <strong>attack bonuses</strong> and types, defenses, hit points, <strong>Initiative</strong> and skills, and so on). Then, when each hero faces an illusion, describe what weapons or items the opponent carries—in other words, the weapons or items used by the other hero. There is no need for an illusion to wield the same exact weapon as the hero behind it, but the weapon should resemble something in the same class (such as a vibrosword, blaster, lightsaber, and so on).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the number of heroes is uneven, one of the heroes is met by a crazed Believer instead of by another hero (for statistics, see “Crazed Believers,”). In this case, the Believer hides behind the illusion of a friend, such as <strong>Senator Organa, Master Denia</strong>, or even one of the other heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Explain to the heroes that they are all inexplicably isolated from one another. Ask for <strong>initiative</strong> rolls, and record the results beside each hero’s name. As soon as an <strong>attack</strong> occurs, use player who is opposite them as a target. If the <strong>attack</strong> hits and <strong>damage</strong> is dealt, record the number. Pretend that the next <strong>initiative</strong> turn belongs to the opponent of the hero just <strong>attacked,</strong> describe the <strong>attack,</strong> and reveal the <strong>damage</strong> dealt. If one hero is fighting a Believer, this fight can be incorporated with the others in order of <strong>initiative</strong> but treated as regular combat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Allow each character a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> at the beginning of their turn to realize that something is not right. Success indicates that the hero can tell that what he sees before him is not real, though it looks as if it could become real at any moment. If a matched pair of heroes goes for <strong>3 consecutive rounds</strong> without <strong>attacking</strong> each other, the entire illusion is dispelled for the whole group, and the angry t’salak <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER EXAMPLE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how this encounter could be run. Assume that the party contains five heroes, so four of the heroes fight each other, while the fifth fights a Believer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Vor’en the soldier (Init 20) versus Arani the noble (Init 14)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kelko the scout (Init 16) versus Sia-Lan the Jedi (Init 28)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Deel the scoundrel (Init 24) versus a Believer (Init 8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 1</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sia-Lan is up first, and she‘s face to face with Count Dooku. But Sia-Lan makes her <strong>Perception check</strong> and knows that Dooku is dead, so she realizes that the encounter must be a trick. She decides<strong> not to attack.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Deel finds himself facing one of his friends, Kelko, who runs madly toward him. Deel asks him what is going on, but his voice is mysteriously soundless. He fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and doesn’t realize that it's a trick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Vor’en fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and thinks that he’s run into a <strong>stormtrooper.</strong> He pulls out a blaster and fires at the enemy, striking Arani and dealing 8 points of energy <strong>damage.</strong> (From Arani’s perspective, she’s shot by an old friend, who wields a hold-out blaster that she gave him long ago.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Kelko (who also failed his <strong>Perception check</strong>) takes out his two vibrodaggers to <strong>attack</strong> a green, tentacled alien that he once encountered on Zlarbv IV. He slashes at it, dealing <strong>12 points</strong> of <strong>kinetic damage</strong> to Sia-Lan. (From Sia-Lan’s perspective, Count Dooku <strong>attacks</strong> her with two lightsabers. The Jedi doesn’t understand what’s happening—she was sure that the appearance of Dooku was some kind of trick!)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next, Arani succeeds on her <strong>Perception check</strong> and tries to convince the phantom that she is no threat, but he doesn’t seem to hear her. She has to defend herself, so she pulls out her own blaster and shoots him, dealing <strong>12 points of energy damage.</strong> (From Vor’en’s perspective, he’s shot by the <strong>stormtrooper.)</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, the Believer acts, rushing Deel and pummeling him to the ground, dealing <strong>15 points of kinetic damage.</strong> (From Deel’s perspective, he’s being <strong>attacked</strong> by his friend Kelko. Has he gone crazy? Regardless, Deel decides that he must defend himself.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Round 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sia-Lan can’t believe it. Count Dooku just <strong>attacked</strong> and nearly killed her. Maybe “Dooku” is a clone, a doppelganger, or something else, but whatever it is, Sia-Lan was hurt for real and must defend herself. She ignites her lightsaber, preparing to <strong>attack</strong> Kelko . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>OOZING MADNESS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can enter the underground park via one of two arches. The t’salak is hiding behind the pond on an elevated slope at the room’s northern side. The heroes must cross the pond to get to the creature, or shoot it from a distance (which is a much wiser option).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Evil. That's the first word that comes to mind as you look at the featureless pool of black ooze. Suddenly, a tendril snaps at you, <strong>attacking</strong> from the creature’s central mass, almost too fast to see. You barely avoid it, but as you dodge, the creature tracks you move for move. It seems filled with hate and bent on pure destruction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A <strong>Force-sensitive </strong>creature of unknown origin, the t’salak is an oozing, black mound of evil. A specimen was first encountered in the jungles of Cularin and subsequently imprisoned inside a <strong>Force-imbued </strong>urn. The urn was buried inside a cave and guarded by a Tarasin village for generations, until recently stolen by the Dark Jedi Raik Muun. With the help of scientists, Raik discovered a way to divide the t’salak into independent entities of equal power. It is unknown how many more specimens remain in existence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak has no sensory organs but leaves no question as to its strength and cunning; it lashes out with sticky tendrils that have surprising accuracy and power. Filled with chaotic thoughts born of malignity, the t’salak can induce a blinding rage in its targets just by touching them, permeating their souls with darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak moves toward the heroes and tries to hit them with its tendrils to induce rage in them. The creature hopes that the heroes will be too distracted by killing each other to <strong>attack</strong> it, so that it can go back to its hiding place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The t’salak cannot be killed by solid objects, but it can be wounded and is highly susceptible to cold and vacuum. Unless the t’salak is trapped within a container imbued by the <strong>Force</strong> or made of Beskar or finally in a cold vacuum while it is inert (0 hit points), it regenerates itself and <strong>attacks</strong> anew.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>T'SALAK</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium aberration, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (natural armor)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 170 (20d8+80)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft., climb 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18 (+4) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 16 (+3) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +8, Con +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Vulnerabilities Cold</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy and kinetic damage from weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Condition Immunities Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Exhaustion, Frightened, Poison, Prone</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses Blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (3,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Induce Raging Madness. When the t'salak deals damage to a creature from a <strong>melee attack,</strong> the creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must make at least one <strong>attack</strong> against the closest ally on its turn. The creature repeats this save on the end of its turn with a successful save removing this effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regeneration. The t'salak regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. When reduced to 0 hitpoints, the t'salak becomes an inert puddle for <strong>5 minutes</strong> and then after <strong>10 minutes</strong> it returns to maximum health unless it is contained inside a container made of beskar, a container that is is <strong>force imbued</strong> or exposed to a vacuum.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ACTIONS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tendril.

Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The t'salak regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tendril. The t'salak makes one attack with its tendrils.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The lake in the middle of the room is an obstacle to the heroes as it counts as difficult terrain. Once across, they can climb the slope on the other side. To reach the area where the t’salak is hiding from across either stream area, the heroes must climb up the 7 foot high muddy hillock that forms the north shore of the pool. It is slippery, requiring a successful <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>. There are some slim trees scattered about the gardens, but they provide very little cover or concealment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THERE'S SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT THIS PLACE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes enter one of the rooms labeled “Dreambeast” (your choice), an extreme cold envelops them. The heroes immediately fall into a profound sleep without realizing it. Read the following text:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you enter the room, your vision fogs momentarily. You shake your head vigorously and feel slightly dizzy. You blink your eyes in rapid succession, then scour your surroundings suspiciously, looking for anything amiss. But everything seems normal. Your friends are all here, and you feel fine now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Still, there is something familiar about this place . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The room is an illusion, a trap devised by the Sith holocron gatekeeper and created by Inquisitor Draco. As the heroes proceed through the sublevel toward the nexus of evil, they are unwittingly immersing themselves more and more fully within Rivan’s aura of influence. This is doubly true now that the holocron gatekeeper of the Dark Lord has found a cohort in the Inquisitor, augmenting <strong>Draco’s powers</strong> significantly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wherever this encounter plays out, the sleeping heroes discover that the room looks identical to one they’ve previously visited. If they attempt to exit the room, they stumble into another familiar area of the academy, but not one normally connected to the room they are leaving, creating a disorienting effect. You should try to create the claustrophobia of a recurring nightmare from which the heroes cannot seem to wake. To drive the point home, you can repeat descriptions of academy chambers that the heroes have visited already. Each time, preface the description with one of the following three phrases (preferably in this order):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There’s something’s not right here . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There’s something familiar about this place . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You’ve got a very bad feeling about this . . .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The longer their minds remain under <strong>Draco’s power</strong>, the more despair eats away at their confidence and motivation. For every encounter that the heroes relive in the dreamscape, their “dream persona” gains one level of exhaustion. However, the heroes can have a maximum of three encounters in the dreamscape. During each encounter, the heroes have a chance to break free of the illusion. With their minds playing tricks on them, they need to overcome their own senses; each hero can make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</strong> once per faux-encounter. If they succeed, they wake up, preventing Draco from further sapping their moral strength. Otherwise, after the third encounter, the heroes awaken regardless, though their exhaustion is persistent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any hero avoids Draco’s trap entirely—that is, if a hero does not enter the room at all—she does not enter the dreamscape. Instead, she realizes that she nearly fell to a dark side trick and can see her friends lying unconscious in the room. Heroes caught in the dreamscape take note of the “missing” party members, and their interaction with them is limited.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any hero who avoided Draco’s trap sees her sleeping friends writhe and groan in mental anguish. She can’t shake them awake, but once per dreamscape encounter, she can try to communicate with them. However, her words will be distorted. The dreamer should be baffled by the gibberish, but a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong> deciphers the words. If that occurs, the hero can make the <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> to realize that he is trapped in a dream state and escape immediately. If the hero fails the <strong>saving throw</strong>, he goes on to have another déjà vu experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless of the manner by which the heroes awaken, immediately thereafter, they must battle a fearsome k’kayeh dreambeast that has anchored itself to the heroes and pursued them into the waking world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes defeat the k’kayeh dreambeast and its spawn, it disappears as if it never existed. A true k’kayeh will make a stunning appearance at the end of the adventure, but for now, heroes can continue exploring the area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THE DREAMS BEASTS ARE MADE OF</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Though the heroes have snapped out of their dream daze, they are still under Draco’s influence and come face to face with an enormous dark side apparition. This semi-incorporeal creature has chased them into the physical world, and the heroes find themselves under assault almost immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As soon as the heroes revive from their collective nightmare, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>No sooner have you gathered your wits from your feverish collective dream than a huge monster spawned from nightmare slithers in through the entryway. Double the size of even the biggest bull rancor, the reptilian colossus drags its golden body into the chamber, scales shifting along its hide like impenetrable plates of anvilstone. As it lets rip an ear-splitting roar, double rows of goring fangs leave little to the imagination.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>K'KAYEH DREAMBEAST (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The k’kayeh dragon is the greatest product of Darth Rivan’s dark arts. A <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> abomination, this Sithspawn’s sandy scales match the color of Almas’ desert wasteland and are as tough as armor plating. The serpentine creature is also amphibious, as comfortable in open air as swimming in the planet’s hidden underground lakes. The k’kayeh’s maw is a steely-toothed deathtrap, and its claws are eviscerating razors. As if that weren’t enough, instead of breathing fire, this dark side abomination can shoot<strong> Force lightning </strong>from each nostril of its monstrous snout.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This “dreambeast” is only a tenth the size of the truly gigantic k’kayeh that lurks in the depths of the Almas Academy, but it is still enormous. Similar to Sith dopplegangers, this k’kayeh dreambeast is an illusory clone of the actual living entity, spawned by Inquisitor Draco under the guidance of Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper. Despite its partially insubstantial state, the dreambeast can still hurt its targets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>K’KAYEH DREAMBEAST</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gargantuan aberration, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 145 (8d20+32)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft., Swim 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>20 (+5) 10 (+0) 19 (+4) 12 (+1) 11 (+0) 15 (+2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Str +8, Dex +3, Con +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy and kinetic damage from unenhanced weapons</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Athletics +8, Deception +5, Perception +3, Stealth +3, Survival +3</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 13</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Can't speak but understands Sith</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 6 (2,300 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Amphibious.

It then makes three attacks: one with its claws, and two with its bite. It can use its devour instead of its bite.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 15 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage. If the target is large or smaller, the target is now grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the K'kayeh Dreambeast can't bite another target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8+5) psychic damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The K’kayeh Dreambeast exhales force lightning in a 90 foot cone. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Devour. The K’kayeh Dreambeast makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the K’kayeh Dreambeast, and it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the K’kayeh Dreambeast's turns. If the K’kayeh Dreambeast takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the K’kayeh Dreambeast must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the K’kayeh Dreambeast. If the K’kayeh Dreambeast dies, a swallowed creature appears within a space that the K'kayeh Dreambeast occupied as K'kayeh Dreambeast's body vanishes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Frightful Roar. Each creature of the K’kayeh Dreambeast's choice within 90 feet of it must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for <strong>1 minute</strong>. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the K’kayeh Dreambeast is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the K’kayeh Dreambeast's Frightful Roar for the next <strong>24 hours</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most disturbing thing about the beast is its snout. Sure, you’ve read the fairy tales about fire-breathing monsters. You may even have fought a dragon-slug on Corulag. But as you watch dark side lightning dance wickedly from one of the creature’s mammoth nostrils to the other, you know only one thing for certain . . . you’re in trouble.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>K'KAYEH DREAMBEAST TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The k’kayeh dreambeast has many weapons at its disposal. Besides its teeth and claws, it uses its<strong> force lightning</strong> breath when avaliable to hit as many heroes as possible. Any cover in the room can be crushed (or appear to be crushed) by the enormous beast. Any hero grabbed by the creature winds up in its mouth to be consumed, taking <strong>damage</strong> from its arm-length teeth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LIVING NIGHTMARE (4)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Living nightmares are manifestations of <strong>Force energy</strong> that appear in shifting, horrific forms. They usually take on the forms of monstrous beings from their targets’ memories and <strong>attack</strong> the minds of their opponents.

If they pass the room without entering it, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the nighthunter that guards Thorla. The blast door is open, and the Twi’lek Jedi Master’s <strong>powers</strong> are kept in <strong>check</strong> inside a Universal Energy Cage designed to contain<strong> Force-users</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DRACO'S BEST FRIEND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes are <strong>attacked</strong> in the corridors outside the prison room.

But your <strong>attacker</strong> is no Sith. Crouched in front of you are 7 hulking feet of quadrupedal, ravenous instinct. The crimson predator is a nighthunter, believed to be as extinct as the Jedi. You consider that the creature might be a good omen in a way—that is, until it bellows a spine-tingling howl.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIGHTHUNTER (1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s the blood-red, blaster-resistant hide. Maybe it’s the claws, which are nearly as long as the fangs protruding up to its eyes and down to its chin. Or maybe it’s the fact that these creatures ambush their prey using the <strong>Force.</strong> Whatever it is, nighthunters give even Jedi pause. Xenobiologists believe that nighthunters are a mutant offshoot of another species, with Myrkr’s vornskrs ranking high on the list due to their whiplike tails, <strong>Force-sensitivity,</strong> and variety of subspecies. Some contend that nighthunters inspired the hellhounds of Corellian myth. No one really knows.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>Force-using</strong> predators have been hunted almost to extinction, but the one guarding Master Thorla shares a peculiar history with Inquisitor Draco. The creature hunted an injured Draco in the aftermath of the Battle of Parein II 4, and they nearly killed each other. However, after wounding the nighthunter, Draco nurtured it back to health, and the beast bonded to its savior. Draco kept the animal and gave it the name Crant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The creature’s hide looks blaster resistant. Its huge anterior claws rake at the floor in tandem with those of its hind paws, grinding out a symphony that hurts your ears and chills your blood. Five immense fangs jut out and over both of its lips, almost concealing its face, except for its two tiny, hungry eyes. As you watch its whiplike tail dancing like a vine snake about to strike, you realize that in this confined space, the beast has a good chance of ripping you into bite-sized chunks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NIGHTHUNTER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium beast, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 72 (13d8+13)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14 (+2) 18 (+4) 12 (+1) 3 (-4) 12 (+1) 6 (-2)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Perception +4, Stealth +10, Survival +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Resistances Energy, fire</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages —</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 5 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Force Sensitive. The Nighthunter's forcecasting ability is Wisdom (power save DC 11, +3 to hit with force attacks).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Nighthunter knows the following powers:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At-will: force camouflage</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Keen Hearing and Smell.

The Nighthunter can make two claw attacks and a bite attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) kinetic damage.

The beast circles around, uses <strong>force camouflage </strong>and stealthily comes back from another direction, perhaps <strong>several rounds later</strong>. You can create tension by having the heroes make <strong>Perception checks</strong> if they are not searching for the nighthunter. They might think it’s gone and proceed with their exploration, only to be <strong>attacked</strong> in a different area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After defeating the beast, the heroes can enter the room it guarded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See the map of sublevel 2.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Use the corridors around the <strong>prison room.</strong> If the heroes find refuge inside a room and lock it, they prevent the creature from <strong>attacking.</strong> But they must come out eventually, and the nighthunter is very patient. The room in which Master Thorla is detained doesn’t have a working blast door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Having dealt with the Nighthunter, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The door is completely open. In fact, burn damage all along the 12 foot-wide entrance appears to have enlarged it. A pulsating glow within lights up the darkened room. Inside, you find a spherical energy cage floating on repulsorlifts. The glow comes from a force field that surrounds the portable <strong>prison,</strong> and behind the bars lies a crumpled humanoid form.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The man, a Twi’lek, meets your gaze with a look of utter despair. Instead of exhibiting hope at the sight of potential rescuers, he quickly looks away, as if to say, “Leave me alone.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This room also contains a thick plasteel table, with traces of a black substance on it and a Jedi robe sprawled across it. Master Thorla is in very bad shape, both physically and mentally. His body is emaciated, and he sports several burns and cuts. To run this dramatic encounter, you must understand the Jedi’s backstory (see the sidebar on page 18). The heroes might suspect that the prisoner is a Jedi and decide to free him. If they interrogate him, Thorla tells them to leave him alone and that he is beyond redemption.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Universal Energy Cage was designed specifically to contain a <strong>Force-user’s powers</strong>. Prisoners in the cage can, however, use the <strong>Force</strong> at very low levels, such as casting cantrips. The cage’s functions are controlled by a handheld remote that is currently in Draco’s possession. The cage has no visible controls, and the only way to open it is to destroy it, which endangers the life of the prisoner within. The Universal Energy Cage has a <strong>damage threshold</strong> of <strong>10</strong> and 55 (5d10) hit points. The cage is also built with a contact shock field, and every time the cage receives <strong>damage</strong> from an <strong>attack</strong> that deals <strong>25 damage</strong> or more, the Jedi inside receives a nonlethal shock that deals <strong>9 ([[/r 2d8[lightning] # Lightning damage]])  damage</strong>, this effect also occurs when an <strong>attack</strong> would automatically miss. When this happens, Thorla yelps in pain, but does not otherwise react.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the Jedi is free, whether he is conscious or not, the heroes notice that his skin is charred in multiple places, showing that he has suffered many shocks. He has four levels of exhaustion, which can only be removed by receiving extensive, long-term medical and psychological care. If Thorla is conscious, he does not run away or try to escape, but he won’t answer the heroes’ questions, either, wanting only to be left alone. He’s been fighting off Draco’s attempts at turning him to the dark side and has fallen into despair. Since the loss of his Padawan, Thorla has become disconsolate, and any mention of Jedi or Imperials angers him. He has an unfriendly attitude and if the heroes physically push or restrain him, he becomes violent and <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter is a chance for heroes with investment in <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> to be very useful. With some good roleplaying and a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, Thorla might be coaxed into revealing that he was a Jedi, but that he no longer has the will to go on. If the player beats a <strong>DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> instead, Thorla will become friendly and additionally answer questions about his captors. An alternative way to convince Thorla to talk is to show Thorla his Padawan’s broken lightsaber (if the heroes obtained it from the Squibs).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thorla can provide the following information:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He knows Inquisitor Draco and Raik Muun, and he suspects that they are inside the archives room in the southwest corner of the sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If asked about a holocron, he reveals that indeed the Inquisitor has one in his possession.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thorla refuses to accompany the heroes willingly. He says that all the Jedi are dead and there is no reason to go on—not with sadistic torturers like Draco running the galaxy. If told of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, the Twi’lek says he’s never heard of her, and besides, one more Jedi won’t make any difference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In any case, when the heroes realize that the broken Jedi will not budge, they should move on. As long as the heroes leave Thorla alive, he might appear again later in the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>VHIIN’THORLA, SURVIVOR OF ORDER 66</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A green-skinned Twi'lek, Vhiin'Thorla studied at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where he befriended fellow student Devan For'deschel. Thorla eventually became a Jedi Master and a skilled duelist, participating in many missions. One of these missions changed his life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>About a <strong>year before</strong> the Clone Wars sparked, he and his Padawan Kritz Drassarb were sent to investigate a band of pirates in the Mid Rim. After <strong>two months</strong>, the ruthless organization was dismantled, but at the cost of Kritz’s life. Thorla blamed himself for his student’s death and exiled himself to his homeworld of Ryloth. He sought solitude in the planet's badlands but soon found a new purpose.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A<strong> few months</strong> into the Clone Wars, Master Devan sent envoys to Ryloth to invite her old friend to join her at the Almas Academy as the new Master of Lightsabers. When the envoys finally found Thorla, they discovered that he had spent the <strong>last year</strong> rescuing Twi'lek prisoners from slavers and had formed a community called the Enclave. Thorla had also taken on a new Padawan, a young Lethan Twi’lek named Dorv'Tilsta. Witnessing all the good that Master Thorla was accomplishing, the envoys respected his decision to decline Master Devan’s offer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Increasing slaver <strong>attacks</strong> forced Thorla to delay a visit to the Almas Academy. Then Order 66 came. Thorla felt the death of his fellow Jedi through the <strong>Force</strong> and moved the Enclave to a more secure location, but after <strong>two long years,</strong> he risked exposure to learn more about the current state of the galaxy. Repulsed by what he discovered, he decided to investigate the fate of his old friend Devan on Almas, taking his <strong>10-year-old</strong> Padawan with him. What he found was a demolished academy at the heart of a ghost town. He probed the ruins, winding his way down to the deepest sublevel, where he knew the secured archives were located.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fate was not on Thorla’s side. Inquisitor Draco and his retinue arrived shortly thereafter, and a fierce lightsaber duel ensued. However, Draco’s Dark Jedi lapdog Raik Muun held Thorla's inexperienced Padawan hostage and induced a murderous rage into young Dorv with her evil t'salak, forcing him to <strong>attack</strong> his own master. A tortured Thorla fended off his Padawan, while Draco threatened to turn the boy to the dark side if Thorla refused to fight. Remorsefully, Thorla finally severed Dorv from life and misery. At that moment, the Twi'lek master snapped and fell to the dark side, racked with guilt over losing another Padawan. He desired to die, but the Imperials denied him this wish. He’s been held in a Universal Energy Cage ever since, meditating on how he lost his way as a Jedi.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PART 3: DRACO'S LAIR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes descend into the depths of the Jedi academy, they draw closer to the nexus of dark power surrounding Inquisitor Draco. You should emphasize the growing sense of dread the heroes feel, including a strong sense of danger for any <strong>force sensitive</strong> players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ARCHIVES ROOM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes reach the archives room (whether they found it themselves or were informed by SevenAy or Master Thorla), they find the door tightly shut. They can open the door by following the procedures described in “Control Room” from the first sublevel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes enter the archives room, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You find yourselves in a long room, 45 feet wide by 80 feet long, with the chamber forking to the right about 30 feet in. Leaning against the smooth walls are cases containing fascinating and rare artifacts and weapons that were of interest to the Jedi. It is surprising that most of them seem untouched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most glaring features of the room are the far wall and floor, which have crumbled away to reveal a cavernous opening that leads into a dark tunnel. This obviously wasn’t part of the room’s original design and seems to be a consequence of the orbital bombardment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This chamber was forbidden to Padawans. It was where the Jedi Masters kept their most precious <strong>Force</strong> artifacts, including the holocron the heroes seek (until it was hidden in the bust of Master Qornah). It also contains the entrance to the underground caves where Draco is consulting with the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan. To keep intruders from interrupting his studies, Draco left behind some of the deadliest henchbeings in the galaxy to guard the cave entrance. Several creatures await the heroes here, as motionless as statues in their hiding places among the shadows. Masters of stealth, these steely, grayskinned warriors are all but undetectable in the dim light.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If players decide to investigate the room they will discover that information that relates to Inquisitor Draco and Darth Rivan's Holocron, specifically that Sith holocrons can sometimes bond to a <strong>force user</strong> granting them additional power. It is possible to disrupt this connection by the use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the heroes enter the archives room, have them roll <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> against the creatures’ <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) checks</strong>, with <strong>disadvantage</strong> unless they have some form of light. If the heroes succeed, one of their light sources or pure chance illuminates what appears to be a five foot-high statue resembling a gargoyle in one of the corners. This is enough warning for the heroes to avoid being ambushed, and a <strong>second later</strong>, six repulsive “statues” pounce on them from all sides. If the heroes fail their roll, the players are affected by the surprise condition as combat starts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the players are not startled and make a successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Lore)</strong> or <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Nature) check</strong>, they can identify the species of their attackers. These squat killing machines are called Noghri, aliens seldom seen away from their home planet. The entire room is considered to be heavily obscured unless the players bring light along from lightsabers or glowrods.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DEATH COMMANDOS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The archive room has no light sources. Even if the heroes restored power to the sublevel, only the faint light from the corridor comes through the open door. The various shelves and cases do not offer cover. The Noghri are perched on marble columns in the far corner of the room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in this area, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s darker here than in any of the other areas you’ve visited so far. A chill breeze hits you from directly in front. How can there be a draft in an underground level? On the map, this room shows as an “L” shape, but you can’t see anything at all around the bend. As you advance, you have the sneaking suspicion that you’re being watched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NOGHRI WARRIORS (5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gray-skinned and compact Noghri are among the most recent and deadly additions to the Imperial ranks. Though an acute xenophobia has begun to manifest within the Galactic Empire, Darth Vader readily recognized the value of the species during a visit to their homeworld Honoghr. When the five foot-tall warriors proved a match for his 501st Legion <strong>stormtrooper</strong> escort, the Dark Lord immediately found a way to enslave the species. Destiny arguably brought the two together, for the Noghri’s frightful faces so resemble the masked visage of their new master, the likeness seems uncanny.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dubbed “Death Commandos,” the Noghri are perfectly evolved killing machines—quick, quiet and deceptively strong. In unarmed combat, they excel at stava, their martial art named after a ferocious native predator, and they wield Stokhli spray sticks or simple knives with deadly efficiency. Vader bestowed Draco with this squad of Noghri assassins in gratitude for the Inquisitor’s assistance in torturing the captured Jedi Knight Halagad Ventor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a flash, you are assaulted by aliens that look like gargoyles. They are short and blindingly fast. As the chaos of combat ensues, you can’t be sure, but the frightening faces of these warriors look like they might have been inspired by the armored mask of a certain Sith Lord—or vice-versa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NOGHRI WARRIOR</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Noghri), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (combat suit)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 83 (11d8+33)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16 (+3) 20 (+5) 16 (+3) 12 (+1) 18 (+4) 12 (+1)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +7 Perception +6, Stealth +9, Survival +6</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Honorghran</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 2 (450 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assassinate.

If they stun or incapacitate the heroes, they bring the prisoners before Draco. Otherwise, the Noghri fight fiercely to prevent intruders from interrupting Draco, but they will be reasonable if they see that they are outmatched. They prefer to fight in melee, using their stealth and martial arts to devastating effect.

The room also contains some ancient Jedi items, none of which offer much help to the heroes aside from a few wooden shields and lances. The items are held inside transparisteel display cases along the south and north walls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>NEARING THE NEXUS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes investigate the opening in the far wall, they see that the crumbled floor and wall have revealed a tunnel. It slopes downward into utter darkness, and the rocky ground is made slippery by the natural spring that runs across the second sublevel of the academy. The slope is 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, prompting two <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks </strong>to get down, a player with a climb speed only makes one <strong>check.</strong> A hero who fails a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>9 or less</strong> suffers a minor slip but does not fall. A hero who fails a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>10 or more</strong> also causes a rockslide, dealing <strong>[[/r 2d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to himself and anyone below him. If the heroes have no light source, they must move even more cautiously and make an additional <strong>Strength (Athletics) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>The players if they have rope, may use that to lower themselves down instead, avoiding the <strong>checks</strong> entirely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENTER THE DRAGON</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at the bottom, Valin Draco is waiting for them, literally surrounded by darkness. He has the controls to Thorla’s Universal Energy Cage in his possession and is studying the Qornah Holocron with the Rivan holocron gatekeeper. As the heroes approach, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You make out a figure in a flowing scarlet robe of septsilk. You recognize him from the message you received many <strong>months</strong> ago after your adventure on <strong>Bespin</strong>: Inquisitor Valin Draco. He is flanked on one side by a stern-looking female whose lightsaber gives a red tint to their surroundings. There is a glint in Draco’s eye and a chilling smile on his lips, as if he already knows more about you than you know about yourselves. Just behind Draco, an incandescent object floats in the air, seeming to grow out of a small cube strapped to Draco’s forearm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hiding behind rocks on both sides of the Inquisitor are two blackarmored Imperial <strong>shadow troopers.</strong> A player who manages to pass a <strong>DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> can barely make them out in the darkness. Draco has the Dark Jedi Raik Muun flanking him, red lightsaber ignited, and directly behind him hovers an indistinct blot resonating with evil. This is the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan, which provides Draco with advanced knowledge of Sith techniques throughout the fight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco is a methodical villain. His preferred method of dealing with his enemies is to convert them to his cause, a tactic that has worked equally well on Raik and the nighthunter, and that nearly succeeded on Jedi Master Vhiin’Thorla. Draco knows that to have reached this far, the heroes must have defeated challenges that would have sundered less formidable foes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, before Draco invites the heroes to join him, he greets them with a single word: “Crant?” This is the name of Draco’s nighthunter. It’s unlikely that the heroes will know this, so Draco elaborates:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Crant—my companion. Have you come to tell me that my nighthunter is dead?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes can tell Draco whatever they wish. If they confirm that they have killed the beast, Draco betrays no emotion, though the glint in his eye dulls. However, he immediately gathers his composure and begins his entreaty as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I am Valin Draco, and, like you, I once thought myself a hero. During the Clone Wars, the brave men and women I commanded called me the ‘Valiant Dragon’ as we fought in epic conflicts for the corrupt Republic. But after I was left for dead on the battlefield of Parein II 4, flattering titles lost their meaning for me. “These are dark times, and I know that you’ve suffered great losses, that you wrestle with the same concerns of virtue and compromise that I did as a Jedi, the same concerns that have plagued the conscientious since time immemorial. Surrender yourselves to the Empire. I promise your treatment will be gentler, and you might even be given the chance to serve me. Surrender yourselves—or face your destiny.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco’s offer is sincere. Here are some possible answers to common questions that the heroes might have for the Inquisitor:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why do you serve the Empire? “Beware rash judgments. The difference between an enemy and a friend is not as obvious as we’d like to think. My allegiance to the Galactic Empire is born of necessity, and you will reap the benefits if you recognize that your destiny lies with me.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is your view of the dark side of the Force? “The dark side exists. Only the naïve and demented believe otherwise. It’s found in each of us without exception—Sith, Jedi, soldier, smuggler, noble, rogue, and romantic. I will show you how to control it so that you needn’t fear or deny it.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why don’t you join us? “I have already found my true self. I embraced my destiny when I took this Inquisitor’s garb. Now, quit this cowardly stalling, and reflect on my invitation, for this is the last time I extend it. Decide swiftly and without regret, for your choice and its effects were predetermined before these words ever obligated you to speak.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s highly unlikely that any of the heroes will take Draco up on his offer. However, this could be an opportunity for some dramatic storytelling. Perhaps one of the players has grown bored with her character. If so, collaborate with her in secret ahead of time so that her character joins Draco’s retinue for a devastating twist, similar to Vader’s revelation of Luke’s parentage in The Empire Strikes Back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In all likelihood, the heroes reject Draco’s supplication or simply <strong>attack</strong> him. Once they do, the disquieting glint in his eye returns, as if he’s foreseen their response. Draco ignites his lightsaber, Raik Muun takes up a protective position in front of him, and the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> prepare to snipe from their hiding spots. As soon as the heroes <strong>attack,</strong> Draco allows the holocron gatekeeper of Darth Rivan to instruct him, teaching him some of the Dark Lord’s powers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes managed to free Master Thorla earlier in the adventure, he arrives at the beginning of the encounter to assist the heroes in their fight. If no heroes discover the means of separating Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper from its connection to the holocron, Thorla uses the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> to grant the heroes a reprieve from the Sith holocron’s influence over Draco on his turns. Thorla has Inspiration, which he saves until the heroes reduce Draco to half his hit points or fewer. When that occurs, on his next turn, Master Thorla gains a use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>, then uses it against Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper, spending the Inspiriation to peel the gatekeeper from the holocron. The gatekeeper howls in rage as it is stripped from the holocron. As the faux Rivan dissipates, the holocron begins to overload, and Draco rips it from his arm and hurls it at Thorla. The holocron shatters, unbalancing Thorla and knocking him into the chasm below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes did not free Master Thorla, he does not come to the rescue. However, he might contact <strong>Force-using</strong> heroes telepathically instead. A Force-using hero in telepathic contact with Thorla can use the Jedi Master’s <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> as though they were the players. Additionally, if the <strong>Force-using</strong> hero does not think to use Inspiration with <strong>Force Suppression,</strong> the Jedi Master tells the hero to do so when Draco is below half of his hit points.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Master Thorla is dead, the heroes receive none of the above benefits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4x CR 1 Shadow Troopers (Headhunter Block) 1x CR 4 Raik Munn (Inquisitor Knight Block) 1x CR 7 Draco (Inquisitor Master)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes start on the east side of the map, at the exit from the tunnel that leads back to the sublevel 2. The opponents are near the opposite side, as indicated on the map, at the end of a ledge that is 40 feet by 10 feet. Raik Muun is in front of Draco, and the four <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are hiding behind rocks, aiming at the heroes. There is another, narrower ledge on the south side of the map, but if the heroes take that route, the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> shoot at them. In the center of the room are two cavernous pits, at the bottom of which lies a body of water.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If his invitation to join him is rebuffed, Inquisitor Draco undergoes a sinister transformation and <strong>attacks</strong> with his minions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“As you die, rest assured that I reflected on you as on all enemies: despising that you must be wrong and I right, but reveling in the triumph of my convictions while whatever species of maggot indigenous to this world expedites the transition of your carcasses from this existence to the next.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While Draco speaks, the sinister blot hovering behind him seems to pulse and seethe with rage. Before your eyes, the wraith seems to transfer some of its dark energy into the Inquisitor, wreathing the Human in shadows. The evil holocron gatekeeper hovering in the room seems to writhe with malevolence, and there is clearly some vile connection between it and the Inquisitor. Draco’s eyes acquire a sickening gold hue, and his voice plummets in pitch as he gives a command to the woman and soldiers at his side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“My brave companions—kill them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Nearly 6'5 tall, with closely cropped hair and a lantern jaw, Valin Draco looks every bit the heroic Jedi he once was. The former Padawan of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, Jedi Draco, the “Valiant Dragon,” embraced his role as a Republic commander in the Clone Wars wholeheartedly. However, at some point during the conflict, his heady determination to defeat the Separatist threat evolved into something pernicious, and he turned to the dark side.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco was thought lost in the chaotic Battle of Parein II 4, but he emerged after the Clone Wars as one of the new Empire’s Jedi hunters. Left for dead and stranded on Parein II’s fourth moon, a weakened Draco was stalked by a nighthunter. Ultimately, Draco subdued the beast in a vicious confrontation, but not before the creature bit off his left thumb and clamped its massive fangs down around his throat. Draco has since replaced the missing thumb with a cybernetic substitute, while masking the glaring scars around his neck with the high collar of his Inquisitor’s tunic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco arrived in the Cularin system in the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> accompanied by a Lictor-class Imperial dungeon ship, Revelator. However, unable to traverse the comet field in the vessel, Draco and his entourage made the journey to Almas in a Theta class shuttle, tucked safely away at what’s left of the Forard spaceport.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Valin Draco activates his <strong>Rage power </strong>and engages the players in melee combat, using <strong>Saber Reflect </strong>or <strong>Parry</strong> when appropriate. He will happily use his <strong>force powers</strong> if he thinks them useful but will always save at least <strong>3 force points</strong> so he can cast Phasewalk to escape to the next chamber when he drops to to half hp or if his allies are killed. During this encounter he does not use any of his legendary actions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR VALIN DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 18 (battle precognition)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 83 (11d8+44)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 20 (+5) 18 (+4) 13 (+1) 16 (+3) 20 (+5)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +8, Wis +6, Cha +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +8, Intimidation +8, Perception +6, Stealth +8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Bocce, Dosh, Honoghran, Huttese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 7 (2,900 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting.

A Zelosian, he defied nearly every stereotype of his gregarious people except for his knowledge of plant biology, and his Sith moniker is believed to have been culled from a corrupted Sith text, possibly written by Darth Revan. As the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith sometime between <strong>1,150</strong> and <strong>1,400 years ago,</strong> Rivan’s story is intimately tied to an object he called the Darkstaff. Drawn to this dark side artifact, Rivan erected a stronghold on the poisonous planet Almas, using the <strong>Force</strong> and his biological knowledge to terraform the world into a paradise. At first, Rivan desired to possess the Darkstaff, but when he learned that it was a malevolent vacuum of power, he became bent on destroying it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the New Sith Wars, Darth Rivan consolidated many dark siders into an army. To circumvent the betrayals common among Sith, he pioneered the creation of Battlelords. This radical process bonded one of Rivan’s Sith commanders—the Battlelord—through the <strong>Force</strong> to his or her troops, such that if subordinates tried to injure or kill their superior, the alchemical bond insured that the traitors would instead be the recipients of the <strong>damage</strong> they intended to inflict.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During a pivotal battle, Rivan simply vanished from the combat zone in a catastrophic and violent way. Legend relates that Rivan at last obtained possession of the Darkstaff that he both craved and feared, and that it created a hyperspace wormhole, known as a <strong>Force Storm,</strong> that annihilated Rivan’s Battlelord army. Caught in the eye of this unnatural tempest, Rivan was flung to a time and place far removed from Almas. He found himself on the planet Ruusan, caught in the War of Light and Dark between Lord Hoth’s Army of Light and Lord Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness. The Darkstaff left Rivan bereft of the <strong>Force,</strong> and when he encountered a <strong>Force-user</strong> of inconsequential power, the Dark Lord was easily dispatched.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Under the influence of dark <strong>Force</strong> energies on Almas, the gatekeeper of Darth Rivan’s holocron has been given the ability to function independently and of its own free will, acting as the real Rivan would.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>DARTH RIVAN'S HOLOCRON GATEKEEPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium hologram, chaotic dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points -</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 40 ft fly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 17 (+3) 15 (+2) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Int +5, Wis +4</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Deception +7, Insight +6, Perception +4, Persuasion +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage Immunities All</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic, Bocce, Dosh, Honoghran, Huttese</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 0 (25 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aura of Malevolence.

Inquisitor Draco reasons that if they’re good enough for the Emperor’s secret Utapau storehouse, they’re good enough for him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Unlike that of other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow trooper</strong> armor retains its distinctive pre-Imperial appearance. There is talk of eventually streamlining <strong>shadow trooper</strong> armor, but for now, their scarlet T-visors remain a haunting reminder of Palpatine’s bloody ascension to the rank of Emperor. Like all other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow troopers</strong> cannot be bribed, blackmailed, or seduced. Any such attempt automatically fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <strong>shadow troopers’</strong> scarlet T-visors give the impression of demonic silhouettes, but their coordination and synchronization of movement reminds you that that these clones are highly trained killers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHADOW TROOPER</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (Human), lawful dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 14 (combat suit)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 23 (5d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13 (+1) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 15 (+2) 10 (+0)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Perception +4, Stealth +7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 1 (200 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cunning Action.

When her affections were not reciprocated, love turned to obsession, and Master Kirlocca dismissed her from the academy. Angered at these rejections, Raik became bent on revenge. She attempted to undermine the Jedi by impersonating members of the Jedi Order while publicly performing acts of sabotage and chaos. Muun also learned of the existence of an evil creature called a t'salak, and by kidnapping and impersonating a Jedi, she gained possession of the beast. Successfully fissioning the creature into multiple entities, she attempted to use two t'salaks to turn some Jedi into crazed killers during a peace conference. Her plan failed, but Master Kirlocca lost his life defeating the t'salaks, and Raik escaped.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Raik returned to her base on the planet Tilnes, she learned about the decimation of Jedi throughout the galaxy as a result of Order 66. Her revenge was now denied, but she could still fuel the rumors of the “Jedi Rebellion.” Raik went to Coruscant to confront those responsible for the destruction of the self-righteous <strong>Force-users,</strong> not sure if she should thank them or kill them. That’s when she met Valin Draco. The Inquisitor saw enormous potential in the wild-eyed Dark Jedi and asked her to join him. Raik felt that she had finally found someone who would love her back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Raik has accompanied Draco on various assignments, indulging in the opportunity to hunt Jedi. When Draco travels to Almas, Raik's familiarity with the academy proves essential, as does the t’salak she brought along.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fire-haired woman stalks toward you, clad in a dark version of the Inquisitor’s attire. She appears Human, but something about her says otherwise. Then you see it. Draco’s gaze shows ruthlessness and calculation, but this Dark Jedi’s entrancing, green-slitted pupils harbor only murder and dementia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>RAIK MUUN</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Medium humanoid (human), neutral dark</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Armor Class 16 (battle precognition)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hit Points 113 (25d8)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Speed 30 ft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11 (+0) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 13 (+1) 12 (+1) 16 (+3)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving Throws Dex +5, Cha +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Skills Acrobatics +5, Intimidation +5</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Senses darkvision 60ft, passive Perception 11</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Languages Galatic Basic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Challenge 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forcecasting.

The <strong>shadow troopers</strong> have the advantage of darkvision. A few large rocks scattered about the cave can offer concealment, or they can be lifted with the <strong>Force</strong> and thrown at opponents. Anyone standing too close to the openings in the center of the area risks falling over the edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>BEHEMOTH FROM BELOW</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At any point when Draco finds himself below half of his hit points, or if his apprentice and <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are dead, he retreats to a back entrance that opens into an immense cavern that is spectacularly lit by bioluminescent, multicolored lichen coating the walls. Draco retreats onto a natural rock overpass bridging a wide chasm that appears as bottomless as it is black. Even in flight, the Inquisitor still tries to push players off the ledge. But Draco is growing desperate, and his connection to Rivan weakens as his resolve does the same. He is prepared to make his last stand here as long as he deprives the heroes of the object they desire—the Qornah Holocron.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, there is one factor Inquisitor Draco hasn’t accounted for. Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper has not been completely forthcoming with him. If the gatekeeper couldn’t retain control of Draco, he planned to summon the real k’kayeh dragon, which has grown to a massive 200 meters (as big as some space slugs) since the Dark Lord first created the monster more than a <strong>thousand years ago.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the gatekeeper is stripped from the holocron, his final howl of rage awakens the k’kayeh and draws it upward. If the gatekeeper is not separated from the holocron, he chooses to summon the beast at this moment. Either way, the behemoth is unleashed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Draco flees onto the bridge formation, he threatens to destroy the Quornah Holocron, holding it out over the chasm as tendrils of <strong>Force lightning</strong> flash from his hands. Though the beast has been released, it is not completely uncontrolled. Still seething with the dark side of the <strong>Force</strong> from his tutelage under the Sith holocron gatekeeper, Draco is able to control the beast—at least enough to keep it from devouring him. Likewise, he bends the massive strikes of <strong>Force lightning</strong> to his will, causing them to lash out at the heroes while he nimbly steps between them. Draco plans to destroy the heroes here, and unless they can defeat him, they will lose</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SETUP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This encounter begins with Draco entering the room and moving to the middle of the large stone bridge that stretches across this canyon. After the events described in the boxed text below, the heroes should be at the entrance to the cavern, with Draco across the bridge, waiting for them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>READ-ALOUD TEXT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the first heroes enter the cavern where this encounter takes place, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco makes a stand midway on the overpass traversing the black gulf. A red lightsaber hisses in his right hand, angled down and away from him, while he extends the precious holocron over the abyss in his left. Then a sound like rolling thunder causes the caverns to shudder, as if the planet itself were growling in fury. Abruptly, as if the sky’s been turned upside down, two blue bolts of lightning the size of starfighters explode toward you from below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the seething electrical masses smashes into the ceiling high above, producing a shower of man-sized boulders. The other mammoth blue bolt sideswipes the bridge, missing you by a mere meter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On the heels of that familiar, unnatural lightning comes a monster straight out of your nightmares—200 meters of golden sinew and obscenity, led by a gaping maw lined with teeth bigger than the tallest Wookiee. It looks identical to the dreambeast you fought earlier, and for a heartbeat you hope that you’re still dreaming. But this is real, and this leviathan makes the illusion you battled earlier look like a tame womp rat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR DRACO</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco, now without the aid of the Sith holocron gatekeeper, has gained some control over both the dreambeast and the <strong>Force lightning</strong> erupting from the abyss below. Before the encounter begins, Draco regains 20 hitpoints from the dark side knowledge he has retained, knowing that he’ll need them in the coming fight. Remember to include any <strong>damage, HP,</strong> or spent <strong>force points</strong> in this encounter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As a <strong>bonus action,</strong> Inquisitor Draco can force an arc of <strong>Force lightning</strong> lances out at a creature, forcing it to make a <strong>DC 16 Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On a failed <strong>save,</strong> the creature takes <strong>16 ([[/r 3d10[lightning] # Lightning damage]]) damage</strong>, <strong>half</strong> on a success. Additionally, all creatures within<strong> 5 feet </strong>of the <strong>target</strong> take <strong>half</strong> the <strong>damage</strong> as well. As a result, he never uses this against targets in which he is engaged in melee.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>INQUISITOR DRACO TACTICS</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco knows that, alone, he could easily be overwhelmed by a group of heroes. As such, he takes a much more defensive position than he did in the previous encounter. He uses the ambient <strong>Force</strong> lightning to keep multiple enemies from getting too close to him each <strong>round.</strong> Similarly, he will use Choke to shut down one hero, letting the k’kayeh dragon do the <strong>attacking</strong> for him (while still shooting an arc of <strong>Force lightning).</strong> If no heroes are engaged in melee, Draco uses his action to dodge, hoping the disadvantage to <strong>attackers</strong> will prevent them from hitting him. Draco uses Saber Reflect when appropriate to deal with any <strong>attacks</strong> that get by his AC, hoping to draw one or two <strong>melee attackers</strong> to him at a time so that he can whittle them down rather than face a barrage from all of the heroes at once.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Draco will also begin using his Legendary Action abilities as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes deal the killing blow to Draco, he drops the Qornah Holocron at his feet. With a gasp, he goes wide-eyed and tumbles from the side of the bridge into the abyss. As Draco plummets into darkness, the <strong>Force lightning</strong> stops, and the k’kayeh dragon descends into the abyss once more, presumably after the body of the Inquisitor. With Draco defeated and the holocron recovered, the heroes need to escape from the collapsing academy with haste.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ENCOUNTER MAP</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[To Be Added]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>FEATURES OF THE AREA</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Two environmental features make this encounter challenging for the heroes. First, most of the combat will take place on a large stone bridge with no railings. Any heroes pushed off of the bridge must attempt to catch themselves or they will fall into the abyss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Second, the k’kayeh dragon stretches up to menace the heroes. Though the dragon would normally be far too powerful for them to face, in this encounter, it acts more like an obstacle than a true opponent. The dragon has an <strong>Initiative bonus</strong> of +6 and an AC of 18. If successfully hit by a ranged <strong>attack,</strong> the beast takes a cumulative <strong>1d4 penalty</strong> to its bite <strong>attack</strong> for each ranged <strong>attack</strong> that hits it. (You should make it clear to the heroes that their combined efforts are having a combined effect, giving <strong>ranged attackers</strong> a role in the encounter while melee combatants deal with Draco.) Once per <strong>round,</strong> the dragon snaps at any heroes in the chamber who are not engaged in melee with Draco, making a melee weapon <strong>attack</strong> with a <strong>+8 </strong>to hit. A successful hit deals <strong>16 ([[/r 2d8+7[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to the target and moves the target<strong> 5 feet</strong> in any direction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LEAVING THE ECHOES BEHIND</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The giant dragon causes major tremors, and the academy’s foundations, already weakened by a major bombardment and <strong>several years</strong> of misuse, start to collapse. This is a good time for the heroes to exit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Describe the ground shaking and falling rocks at random points. Reuse the fallen debris from the Cave-In section a few times as the heroes make their way back up toward the surface. Appropriate points on the map would be the tunnel leading to sublevel 2, the stairs leading up to sublevel 1, and any corridor on sublevel 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the heroes survived their encounter with Draco relatively unscathed, feel free to run more encounters on sublevel 2. For example</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some Believers might have escaped the heroes’ first trip through the level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The nighthunter or the t’salak might have survived.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The library on sublevel 1 might have some guardian spirits still roaming around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some Dark Lizards might still be stalking the ruins on the top level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These encounters should be run in the corridors, delaying the heroes from escaping and creating a rising sense of urgency. If none of these encounters is appropriate, or if the heroes overcome the challenges easily, they might encounter more pirates as they return to their ship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once the heroes climb up the turbolift shaft and are out of the ruins, read the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you run through the ruins of the academy’s ground floor, the remaining walls of the fountain room and the columns in the entry hall collapse around you, showering you with dust. As you leap for the exit out of the academy, huge clouds of dust billow into the air, obscuring your view as the ground quakes and devours the ruins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the dust clears, you could not have imagined how good Almas’ toxin-filled air would feel in your lungs. It’s a good thing you rescued the holocron, because no one will be able to go back down there for a long, long time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Looking away from the falling rubble, you see the familiar buildings of deserted Forard city. You feel like resting a bit before walking back to your ship. You can’t wait to reunite with your uncomfortable bunk bed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Master Denia</strong> will be grateful that you’ve recovered the holocron. You should return to the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>soon, before more Imperial agents come looking for Inquisitor Draco.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The heroes shouldn’t have too much trouble reaching their ship. If it needs repairs, they have to perform the work uninterrupted for a <strong>few hours</strong>. The Imperial dungeon ship that Draco brought is still in the system, accompanied by his Star Destroyer, the <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> but they are outside the comet field. The heroes detect the Imperial ships once they clear the comet field, but the ships are too far out of weapons range to <strong>attack.</strong> If the heroes scan the ships, they identify one as the Assiduous (which they should recognize from the battle over <strong>Bespin</strong>) and the other as a Lictor-class dungeon ship named Revelator. They could not detect the ships on their way in because the Imperials were stationed in Cularin’s shadow. But now, not having received a report from Draco in <strong>several hours</strong>, the Revelator approaches the limits of the system to launch another shuttle. It does not pursue the heroes, but it <strong>attacks</strong> if they are daring enough to come within range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>CONCLUDING THE ADVENTURE</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the heroes leave the Cularin system, they can reach the last known coordinates of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. The trip back takes<strong> one day</strong>, giving the heroes time to rest, treat their wounds, and study the holocron. Any <strong>non-Force-sensitive</strong> heroes find the cube unresponsive, but a <strong>force user</strong> can conjure the holocron’s gatekeeper, Master Qornah, who answers a few basic questions but insists on the presence of another Jedi Master.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When they finally approach the Nebulon-B frigate, the heroes receive a communication from <strong>Captain Verana</strong> asking if their mission was successful. He greets them as they dock underneath the large ship and walks them to their quarters. When the heroes are ready, they are instructed to go to the briefing room to meet with <strong>Master Denia</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Denia</strong> asks the heroes for the holocron and activates it. She then listens as the heroes recount their adventure. At the mention of Draco’s name, <strong>Denia </strong>displays a brief look of shock and becomes very pensive thereafter, as if distracted by something far away. Gathering her composure, she states the following:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This sounds like quite an ordeal you experienced, and whether you follow the Jedi ways or not, you have contributed greatly to the enlightenment of the Force. With this item, I will seek answers about the slaves that you rescued at <strong>Bespin</strong>, and hopefully some clues about the Empire’s Sarlacc Project. I am also curious about the creatures and evil forces that you encountered in the academy, and if I find information about them, I will advise you. But now if you’ll excuse me, I must meditate.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any of the players are level 7 in a <strong>force using class</strong> who have an appropriate background, <strong>Jedi Master Denia</strong> will officially make them a Jedi Knight in a ceremony before the next chapter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WWW.GMBINDER.COM</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This document was lovingly created using GM Binder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you would like to support the GM Binder developers, consider joining our Patreon community.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>GM Binder</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Discover</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Log In</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Register</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Further Information</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Terms of Service</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Us</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>    </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"CqLtwMndnIAIyLTB","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
